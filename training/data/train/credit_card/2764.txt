okay credit cards they leave a bad taste in my mouth uh yeah theyve sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too ive been sort of irresponsible a couple of years ago and im still paying for the the my own stupidity well the thing i hate about them i went through a divorce and i will never own another joint credit card oh youre because uh even if in the divorce decree one is agrees to pay it if youre a cosigner on it theyll still come after you if the other person doesnt if the other person doesnt and boy that thats thats a rotten deal oh id id say so and isnt it now on those those cards was it mostly her that that ran up the bills yeah about twenty thousand dollars worth twenty thousand i cant imagine any anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit card wholly smokes but uh they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it yeah thats got to be like close to what a thousand bucks a month and they said well im sorry even though the card is in her name you youre a cosigner on it and i i threatened you know legal action and everything i i dont know ive sent them a letter and i said i want this removed from from my credit rating and uh havent heard anything back but i havent run a credit check either yeah you might be worth your while to run one of them thirty dollar uh credit checks just to find out what it says but uh thats uh ill never own another joint credit card i need to find i need my credit card mostly for uh just government travel you know um uh program manager for the Air Force and uh i uh i have to go on uh travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but ive been trying to curtail my use of it to to nothing except with the exception of uh of them those type things and i also found out something else uh for your information and i dont know if youre married or not no im not but uh one of the credit cards the uh the account was paid off oh it was paid off for a couple of years never even used it and then all of a sudden i got a phone call from them saying uh uh shes behind in her payments and i said well i dont care shes my exwife and uh they said well your name is still on file as cosigner oh gee so even dormant credit cards you have uh you you have to go and send them a copy and tell them youre not responsible for any bills but uh it it can turn into a mess sounds like it so the the credit card was inactive yeah it was inactive and i never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or anything because they wasnt even mentioned in the divorce decree as to which party would pay what what when you oh my gosh because the the credit card was zero it was you know dont and it was dormant guess the the bottom line is uh you got to be darn sure youre marrying the right person when you thats right when you do that laughtertoo but uh i guess a divorce in any circumstance doesnt normally theyre either that or make or each each party have their own own uh credit card not a joint thats for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who um a girl i used to date her brother and his his wife ran up thousands of dollars in credit well i guess theyre they are both responsible for the stupid things but um had a similar situation and then it was almost like he couldnt get a divorce because uh uh i guess she didnt even work or anything and then he wouldve been strapped with everything yeah he would have been stuck with everything i remember vocalizednoise about the only credit cards i have now are are gas cards but theyre in my name only i know im about uh thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to lump everything together so that and its down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only little yeah system because uh im just i am very sort of irked at this at these credit card companies and you know they got you yeah and uh youll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your credit line and uh and it also makes it bad because you cant deduct that interest now no no you know at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct deduct all that interest and finance charges cant even do that anymore yeah i remember uh was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right well you uh this last year was ten percent this next time its zero well remember my refund on my income tax was a lot bigger uh two years ago than it was this year thats for sure yeah about only the only interest you can deduct now are is a house payment mortgage interest and uh and taxes but uh credit cards you can i cant even declare that here because uh in my situation because its uh not until i sell it the way the way it works for me because i own it as jointly with my father and uh theyve changed those vocalizednoise or its a ends up getting classified as a rental property and its not classified as a regular family dwelling so theres some reason we cant declare any mortgage interest vocalizednoise do you do you or your father either one have it homesteaded um do you mean do we do i live in it or no no homesteaded what does that mean uh in Texas uh you get a uh a big tax break if you if you call what they homestead it you have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary residence and and i live here oh oh and well that would be an interesting situation because im a resident of Pennsylvania and uh because im in the Air Force and um im living here in New York so i can i cant even vote here a property owner but i cant vote laughter thats crazy well thats only fair because the reason im a vocalizednoise resident resident of Pennsylvania is because they dont charge military income tax oh thats so so and so its like Texas Texas doesnt either at least now yeah or theyre theyre talking about instituting a uh state income tax everything else that that would bring in money the uh the the people want it but the uh the congress or Texas State Congress and so forth wont pass a bill to do it like a uh lottery theyve been trying to get a lottery vocalizednoise i think the last poll they had here seventy percent of the population voted wanted a lottery and yet the uh the House voted it down the Texas House voted it down they all they want to do is increase property taxes and put a income tax in i dont know getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best uh maybe is that even though the American Express charges the annual fee is the American Express card is it makes you pay it every month it makes you right it makes you pay it i i do have an American Express but i got it through uh TI yeah ive got a Diners Club through the government as well yeah they its a its a yeah its a yeah its a corporate they force us to have yeah uh government Diners Club and i had an American Express of my own i probably if i was smart id get rid of the American Express and get stop paying that annual fee on it but yeah and if youre late on this on my American Express they write TI since its a corporate corporate American Express that thats not good and if you dont pay it you get a call from your supervisor saying why hasnt this been paid yeah oh jeez so you dont dare run up anything on it that you cant you know that you cant pay thats thats the problem with credit cards it its people dont think of it as cash they think of it like uh monopoly money that hey i can just charge this and pay it wherever i feel like it yeah its like going oh ill have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and few other things and then youre like oh jeez laughter yeah i know that feeling laughter so i guess the the secrets not to have credit cards yeah oh well im getting to just about to that point myself so well i guess weve been im surprised they hadnt beeped in and said your ten minutes is up yeah really theyve been vocalizednoise theyve been uh even before ten minutes here lately theyve been saying you should cut it off oh really i havent i i weve actually havent timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation ends on its own or uh or that uh that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice well listen ive enjoyed talking with you yeah its nice talking to you Jerry and uh

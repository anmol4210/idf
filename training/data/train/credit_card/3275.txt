so do you have an opinion on credit cards um i do laughter you do what do what do you think about them i think they get a lot of people in trouble yeah definitely i have one right now and um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldnt get laughter yeah and then you dont stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you dont stop to think about it i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble oh my goodness and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a Visa card and i never use them unless i need to  so thats good yeah yeah id i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldnt pay it in full every month that id have to rip it up so but they thats a good idea stops all them interest rates and interest rates arent none too shallow these days anyway yeah that  but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know we have im in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech  and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot umhum i have i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out laughter and they they cant do anything but work to try to pay them off and and and like one of my friends  yeah she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she does she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because shes going to school and and so i mean thats just enough to pay rent and buy like laughterthirty five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twenty yeah you have i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all shes paying is interest on hers every month yeah something like that it just seems crazy to to me but  well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and she was making like i dont know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month  so and that was before we got married so  but its you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and its its come out pretty good now we have a eighteen year old thats fixing to get out of high school and go to college and oh really thats the first thing he wanted was it Visa card oh my goodness so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick laughter i bet you know so yeah im i dont know im about sick of mine right now i dont but i think theyre too readily accessible and theres too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you draft get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but thats a lot of pain and hassle when you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh we couldnt afford everything we didnt have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need vocalizednoise exactly yeah my parents are really good about not using credit cards they are against it laughter i dont think they like the fact that i have one either i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldnt have the problems we have course we wouldnt have the retail market we have either so i guess theyd trade one for the other i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other well thats good im it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so yeah im nineteen im twenty right now so just going to school and are you yeah  and working so all right it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them and laughter on my credit card i didnt didnt have the money to do it yeah its pretty easy it sure is so do you just have two kids or uh we have a eighteen year old a seventeen year old and a seven year old oh really im from Plano Texas oh are you but right now im out in Provo Utah going to BYU so are you a youre a Mormon then yep laughter all right but this is a extra long one whats that hey theyre giving us a lot of time laughter oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays vocalizednoise yeah have you done a lot of this uh fifteen or twenty i guess oh really oh yeah do you do it every day i try to every day i uh i get calls at work i get calls at home so

well ive had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but oh really uh i ive been thinking about the fact that the uh GrammRudman Act that was eventually originally passed uh to satisfy to satisfy satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a set of handcuffs on Congress just doesnt work because now we do things outside the GrammRudman with consent of Congress i guess and that doesnt seem to help us to much uh i mean the savings and loan was a great example of that thats outside the Gulf War was outside so it doesnt it i guess we just dont have the resolve to to really face up and and and follow those instructions if if indeed they are politically viable yeah i believe uh i believe thats right uh i guess uh uh you know really what weve got to do is is face up to the fact that uh our economy just will not support uh all of the programs that you know that the the the some of the people and i think its you know the minority numbers not in minorities uh you know im not talking racial stuff but minorities minorities in numbers  uh uh want to have passed uh special interest groups uh have you know their own agenda and i think that its time that uh Congress faces up to what i think the the people in general have faced up to is that we just cannot really support all of those things uh it seems to me that that theres theres a couple of ways that that ive listened to uh various Congress people and the President and the opposition and other people propose and and one thing thats starting to ring a little true to me is um rather severe cuts in in the defense programs since like closing bases and closing down programs etcetera simply because i i just dont believe as much as they want me to believe some of the special interests that you talk about that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer right i i believe thats true i mean were seeing this thing just crumble if if anything now i see the President wants another billion two and a half billion to loan them money because hes afraid of the outright uh chaos and confusion and anarchy because theres no food over there well i yeah you know one of the things that i look at uh uh im in the Dallas area and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the the uh bill thats that called for the closing of military bases and one of the bases thats being closed or thats on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by and when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed there was really a a huge cry you know from the Dallas Fort Worth area about you know how its you know that one is the one that should not be closed you know its its not fair you know laughterto to Dallas Fort Worth but uh you know when Amorys laughter exactly bill passed everybody said hey thats a great thing you know were going to cut back on some of this unnecessary spending just dont gore my ox right right and uh you know i think thats the the same case that that you know would hold true for a number of other programs uh we all talk about uh about how the the uh transfer payments you know are not handled correctly uh you know the the welfare programs and some and some of those things and you know they all need major overhauls yes thats right they all need major overhauls until theyre the ones you know until its the one that that i sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from or you know the laughterone that that my children or my grandchildren or my mother or grandmother you know that weve all we all all got a special interest group that uh you know thats benefiting from some of these uh oh i guess wed almost have to i mean i dont know it just seems to me wed almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didnt have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but i was wondering about you know i i was a little bit encouraged although it didnt seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when they last Fall when they they they did levy a tax on some of the people richer people i mean they increased that bubble tax there i i was a little encouraged by that because thats another way to cure the deficit is by higher taxes nobody wants to pay higher taxes but i mean theres going to be a crisis one of these days thats going to force us to do it anyway right i i i vocalizednoise agree with that i im an accountant a CPA and i went to a seminar some seminars today and uh one of our opening speaker our keynote speaker this morning yeah yeah  yes yes was is the president of one of the major Texas companies or fairly major anyway and one of his comments had to do with the state taxes  the state state tax the state Texas is uh you know is in a little bit of a bind tax wise and one of the proposal is uh to uh have a new state income tax but to have it only on on corporations yeah yeah and of course you know hes corporate president corporate uh CEO and uh that was just not the right thing you know laughter the the corporations are paying too much tax already so its you know well they pass it on to us laughteranyway laughteri ive never ive never even thought that they that they would absorb laughterthat laughterright so the same you know right the same you know same thing applies you know if the tax is is geared to you know or or aimed toward me then its a bad tax if its aimed toward you its a good tax laughter yeah laughter thats right of course it that that vocalizednoise thats again that that issue just like you sited Amorys bill on the bases but i i dont know i vocalizednoise it just seems to me that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i i think im correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget is is is allocated now for debt payments right yeah i believe at least that much or interest payment on the debt but uh yeah and and and i know if i had to pay that much in my out of my salary i mean it it its it it just seems to me i dont know whether it it thats kind of a colloquium just use common sense but it it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point when the Medicare programs cant pay off when the when when they cant pay off the the the savings and loans uh uh situation when the banks cant be insured any longer when the pensions cant be insured then people are really are going to demand something to be done but it appears to me that i dont know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place you know i i think that uh you know i think were just going to have to laughter as as Gerald Ford said were going to have to bite the bullet and uh uh and yeah but how do you get people to do that though i mean i i i i i dont even find myself you know i see i i play that game with myself sometimes i know things are a little tough so i say well ill just charge this on the credit card and ill pay it off in a little bit and then then every once in a while i get a shock i get the credit card up to six seven thousand i say this is absolutely insane and we sort of tighten up or something comes by to pay the damn thing off but right yeah i i i i i think that were not paying anything off i mean obviously were not paying anything off we weve gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in the last ten years and yeah vocalizednoise and i i guess thats the the problem or you know vocalizednoise as i see it anyway that we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as individuals would do and thats you know we cut off our spending and cut off our charging when our when our credit gets out of hand you know laughter yeah thats right yeah i saw some Japanese guy on television today he was talking about the the the trade deficit he said as long its so its so simple that that it was it was kind of it was kind of humorous he said as long as you continue to spend more than you continue to uh sell as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell youll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that thats your problem well i mean i i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but i guess it is the truth we just keep laughterbuying laughterthis laughterstuff and we dont have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas and it is a very complex situation but uh i i guess but as a as an accountant do you do you find people are worried when you talk to them about what our government might do or  yeah i think uh i think vocalizednoise not so much about what the government might do but that you know theyre worried about what theyre not you know what they cant seem to do uh its you know its its everybody seems to agree vocalizednoise what they cant seem yes that that thats right that were really in you know in dire financial situation that something has to be done and the concern is that nothing is being done you know yeah i was i guess i was a little comforted by the fact that on this Gulf War uh that we have received uh at least sixty percent of the money laughter that we asked for and i i should imagine i dont know how thats coming you know i remember some i i just dont i havent seen a real accounting of that yeah i have not uh have not seen that so i guess i guess uh uh if i was to take a position now and sum up because i dont want to talk too long is that the short term i guess we have to some how as you say address those issues in the long term wed either have to wed have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big the transfer payments and the military an and just bite that bullet right i and im i believe thats right okay okay laughterokay laughternice laughtertalking to you uhhuh bye okay im going to cut it off and uh because ive got to laughtergo nice talking to you Bob byebye

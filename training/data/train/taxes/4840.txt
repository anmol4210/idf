 okay uh laughter well we just got our income tax return and im perfectly happy what about you laughter well lets see um i havent gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the Bay area so im not sure how much im getting back but im pretty sure should get back a little bit since im still a student so not too much not too bad though but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think its pretty high but i im uh you know i i guess thats where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that that we have and yeah it its one of  those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but uh although it is kind of a pain sometimes though its just scary though about you know how high are the taxes gonna be when my children are my age you know that thats thats scary too because its not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child so you know that thats a scary part too that you have to think about yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because were vocalizednoise were increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex and you know taxes are one of the ways that help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society i mean everything from you know from Medicare to um to Social Security to um to feeding the homeless to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that and its now theres more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and you know its its becoming a a large responsibility but someone someone has to pay for it and thats us yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know the taxpayers are your money is your money going to where you want it to go and theres gonna be a special this week i i cant i cant remember if its Twenty Twenty or one of those things where um i think its one of the local news i think theyre having an a documentary something about that about theyre trying to catch some people about not spending your tax pay monies right and fraud and that kind of thing you know and thats kind of scary too and uh so that would be interesting to see i wanted to see that program yeah and and even even today its like you know theres still a considerable amount of taxes that you know were paying for but youd think that were still in this this this uh deficit state that were still not able to pay off things just because i laughterknow the budgets not big enough as it is and makes you wonder when theres vocalizednoise you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher you know its like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that thats kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesnt come down to that yeah laughter but on the other hand they also while while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and its good but its its the price they pay laughter i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically its actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and dont try and generate a larger um a large amount of revenue because theres so little um currency flow through out the economic system you sure do know a lot know a lot laughter uh just keeping up with the times thats all yeah yeah as it as it turns out you know its one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because well its nice to know that when im actually you know i do start working that ill like to know like where my tax dollars are going too vocalizednoise i work hard to to get you know i like to know where its going to thats true what do you think about these items that are gonna be um taxed even more like um tobacco and that kind of thing i think in a in a way its good in a way its not um but i think in general its probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past um have been not taxed because theres been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies and its things like tobacco are um theyre theyre a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers and its as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example theres an ordinance which states that um theres no smoking in any public areas and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel theres no smoking allowed anywhere oh really

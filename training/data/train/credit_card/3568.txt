this is a kind of ironic subject for me because this is the first year um i purchased i mean i i was actually able to uh get some credit cards because im twenty one and i got it through school and i ive kind of you know you kind of make a purchase and you and you forget you know what you put on your credit card and you know within a month you know they send you your bill and uh i im about three thousand dollars in debt right now oh dear laughter it can add up in a hurry yeah they do i mean its amazing its like a an an illness or a sickness or something well its its uh its easy to use theres no doubt about them ive had ive had one for oh probably ten years now and if you can if you pay it off every month generally generally youre okay um our experience has been um we usually pay it off each month but around Christmas time we sometimes have to slide a month or a month or so to yeah Christmas time i can understand but what my after i got one i didnt just stop i got ive got about five yeah get caught up oh uhhuh theyll send you one about every time you turn around six six credit cards yeah and uh so i just charged a little on each laughterand laughteruh laughterand you just get the um the adding machine out and you add it up and its its amazing well you see these people that cut theres up say its time to we went to we went on vacation and uh and i charged a lot you know just well i charged um like clothes for the vacation and then on the vacation you know charged your hotel and then you know when you got to eat you charge laughterthe laughterrest i mean you know its so convenient and oh and theres uh and you just dont i guess you know im just really stupid i just didnt realize well i like them for a couple of aspects one is you dont have to carry a lot of cash with you and the other is you know you got that statement and you can make one payment you dont have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for things its convenient from that standpoint so its its nice from that standpoint from that angle but it can get out of hand in the interest rate on them is is quite high generally there are some that are lower you know you can get some that are oh probably around twelve thirteen percent but most are around sixteen to eighteen or higher yeah i have a friend that um shes married and her and her husband uh she said you know they tried really hard to pay them off and it took them three years before they were able to uh pay off their credit cards yeah although you know they keep increasing your limit too you know i had a card that uh well i think it started out with like a fifteen hundred dollar limit and ive had it for several years and i think im now up to uh seven thousand five hundred on it i mean im not course i dont always spend that much but thats what theyd let me spend if i wanted to i guess they they get to trusting you a little bit and i want to hold that bait out i dont know if the card companies that you have usually around Christmas time theyll theyll send you a little group of checks say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and well charge itll go right against your account they they try to induce you during the Christmas season to to wrack up a few more laughterdollars so i think theyre good but youve got to be careful thatd be my overall summary i think it was hard for me because i wasnt working at the time and i was just going to school and it was like every weekend i would just its it was like sickness to laughterme laughterand laughteri laughterjust laughtergot and just spend uh but well  i dont know  everybody likes them at least for a couple of things theyre theyre handy theyre nice on when you travel just yeah what kind do you have um i have a Discover oh uhhuh and a Visa a Sears and i have like most of the department stores yeah well the Discover one is supposed to pay you back a little bit have you experienced that or not i have um i have maxed that one what have you well thats uh i think that ones sponsored by Sears if i yeah it is and i got the Sears through the Discover before i had um and i didnt even know i went over my limit i mean thats i just didnt even add it up i dont know im just oh yeah i was just going crazy  well and theres about fourteen hundred dollars on that card well it can it doesnt take long i i just ordered a video camera yesterday and thats why that always bothers me a little bit to give your credit card number over the telephone but i umhum i wouldnt do that i would not do that ive seen on TV and and theres too many scams and there there can be theres no doubt about it weve

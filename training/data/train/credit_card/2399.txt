okay um lets see how do you feel about laughtercredit cards laughter personally i do not care for them uh although i find them a necessity in business and so forth i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible for a number of reasons one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express and uh im not  im not terribly in favor of them not for my own personal uh point of view plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least thats one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard do you use them frequently or well we uh me and my wife when when we have like extra money that we know were going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah well well use it but like last year i think we paid um i think it was like twenty something cents interest on our Visa and i think this this year we uh i think we used it for Christmas and we got caught just a few days on our grace period and uh so well pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars but we dont like to do that at all and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly we uh we have several credit cards though um we have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express and i think we have a couple of department stores but we use it the same way and uh i find the one i use mostly uh aside from the American Express i do use my Sears card i try vocalizednoise as with the American Express i try to pay it you know as it comes in right right so uh its its not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill thats usually how we do it i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my American Express card before i would before i left i would mail a check to to American Express you know have some idea of how much was there you know id sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever i felt i would spend and then use it then but uh you know for hotels and and so forth but uh but i knew that it was paid i knew laughter i knew that i had that much credit going in sometimes you know sometimes i would go over but uh it wouldnt you know it wouldnt hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect well thats good ive i dont think weve gone that far weve laughterbeen before laughter to pay it in advance you know in advance before we spend it but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good well i found you know i found in um in traveling overseas that uh it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card oh really for uh for hotel bills and so forth plus i would uh when they would send the bill and they would automatically convert to the exchange rate right right now the only time time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically uh for example i remember on one trip to France when i started planning the trip i think uh a dollar was worth nine or ten francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically and when when i finally got over there it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the laughter so i got caught a little short in that regard but uh uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh lets say if it were say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so or maybe twenty dollars maybe it would be more than that it was more than vocalizednoise it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate right right but then laughter when i got back and i was working for the government at the time uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate right yeah so theres a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate that that was the only time i really got caught short and i yeah especially but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard yeah well thats thats good and it yeah yeah well from where are you calling oh from the Dallas area so youre from Dallas okay im from Maryland oh really yeah laughter wow vocalizednoise do you work for TI no i work for GTE well really um uh i wonder how TI got GTE involved well i know Jack Godfrey oh okay i know him very well ive known Jack for a long time and im also in the speech business oh okay so when i heard that Jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this and uh so thats how i got involved yeah you have a very um very whats the word your your speech is very exact oh thank you very much laughter but uh vocalizednoise laughter as Jack said im one of the uh the old hands in the speech business i ive ive uh yes i ive been doing it for twenty some odd years oh really and so uh uh i was very much interested in uh getting involved in uh switchboard uh you work for TI right i i work in uh a wafer fab oh really oh i guess were supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording laughter yeah laughter i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject so i think you get ten so laughter well all right i think were okay okay fine well you have a good

 okay Vic our topic is budgets do you keep a monthly budget uh i talk about doing that a lot laughter laughter welcome to the club laughter uh i i use a uh computer software program to keep track of all expenses primarily its a checking you know a check balancing program but it does categorize categorize everything oh how interesting and and it allows you to either to go in and create a budget and then compare against it or actually will sort of generate one based on you know how you categorize things over the over the months so i have all the information there um its just that i havent been very diligent at at really tracking it and following it well uh its just like the money its hard to keep track of it laughter as it goes out right right what do you do uh im a teacher and were at a my husband and i are at a stage in life where weve got one left in college so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in college laughter their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances laughter okay okay weve quit laughter um well the biggest problem that ive had or one of the one of the problems is um keeping track of cash expenditures you know expenditures uh i think that one of the things thats uh makes budgeting very hard is the convenience of automatic teller machines uh the ability to go up and get cash so easily okay i see i stopped those four years ago yeah okay well see you have control yeah oh yeah now we are you know um well were at a point in life that were looking to retirement rather than you know earnings so its gotten to the point where um yeah automatic automatic teller i only had the card and it was on my own personal account and it got way out of control very fast so i have a tendency now i take an allowance and when its gone its gone you know im finished if its gone the fifteenth of the month then its gone well thats pretty good its gone huh oh thats great and uh we have a tendency not to use cash we pay everything by check right yeah thats a good way to do it and so that way we we keep control of what were spending where its going what its going for umhum well thats great so um you know it i take a hundred dollars a month thats all i take and you know i mean i dont buy groceries out of it its my own little oh wow slush fund if you wanna call it that and thats for my little incidentals or running to the grocery store to get a you know gallon of milk or whatever umhum yeah but um after that its check only so we can you know really know where our moneys going and you know whats happening what about how are you on charge cards uh pretty good about that that the last few years anyway we did have a Master Card that got out of hand for awhile but we just just stopped using it didnt get rid of it there are times uh such as oh some mail order type things uh where its very convenient to have uh but thats really the only thing it its used for and uh one one problem i do have is with uh is it i in my job i travel a good bit and have to use my own uh credit card i dont have a business credit card so i use that and then have to file expense reports and uh it just adds another complication to properly tracking expenses knowing how much of it is reimbursed business expense uh or how much is my own expense for yeah i i use uh credit cards not for credit but just for convenience in other words i pay we pay monthly the balance due uh but we do okay yeah well this might help you because see my husband travels as well and we have separate charge accounts hes got an American Express and thats only traveling then we both have a Visa or MasterCard so anything on his American Express is his thats a pretty good way to do it and its his expense now he gave me one and if i go with him on work i only charge on that card i dont put it on my MasterCard so weve separated those two completely and i know what you mean because at first we used to intermingle our funds and we werent sure  why our bills were outrageous oh yeah its hard to be sure to be sure you know because his traveling expenses were you know i mean hes a traveling salesman so were looking at six five oh boy

uh well i i kind of feel like we pay um um maybe uh little uh too much actually i mean like twenty five thirty percent of our income the average family you know vocalizednoise uhhuh yes absolutely and it just seems uh um and yet you have big corporations that that manage uh just because the way the laws are written not to pay anything at all year after year after year uhhuh yeah no i i agree with you there um ive gone to other states where theres no food tax you know some things there arent taxed at all and i think that thats really nice i think they thats what Texas needed to do also is to discriminate as to uh which should be taxed and what shouldnt be taxed so uhhuh i dont ive never been any place that didnt have it we went from here to North Carolina for a while and and they had a food tax there so i guess im just kind of oh see we dont they dont tax food here do they no they do they do uhhuh yeah but i have lived in other states in which they dont uh tax uh food uh clothing items personal things like that they do tax and um so that was that was really neat but i guess the way that they get around it though is that theres no quote state income tax but then you pay laughter ten fifteen percent taxes um you know i know they say its only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh but yeah i really think that its its way too much no state income tax right uh whenever you buy an item especially a large purchase item it its its something in which youre youre paying and youve always got to add in that about ten percent tax laughter uh what do you feel about do you feel like um how do you feel about for what we get back in the way of services and things in the last what in in the way of services for for the money that we pay oh in the money that we pay um well  now for the city of Plano um i really like the the things that they offer here yeah i do too um i and i cant say that for for all of Dallas or all of Texas um but for Plano i do i really think that i get my my moneys worth they always seem to be ahead of any other um city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping Plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too so yeah yeah well we participate in a lot of the recreational you know we use the recreational facilities umhum umhum and uh  where we came from in North Carolina i mean it was a nice area but we didnt have any the mean the the recreational recreational facilities they have here are just unbelievable so i think that we get a good deal in the way that goes  right umhum umhum well and i think you get spoiled and you expect it whenever you go to any place else and its just not quite up to standard or par and its just like oh gee whiz you know it makes you really appreciate i think uh you know that your city and uh what it has to offer now as for the state you know i uh uh you know i guess the the highways outside of what metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay laughter i dont know i havent i havent been much i havent been much outside well yeah i used to travel when i was here and they seem to be okay yeah and the outside i mean the your state highways i i think you know are are pretty adequate uh adequate but gosh you get into the cities laughterand laughteryou might as well forget it um yeah yeah now we lived in Houston for a while in the vocalizednoise and in in the city was pretty pretty pretty rough in places right yeah so um i i dont know im uh im really glad that they didnt go to the um the the state income tax um im hoping the lottery is going to uh take care of it uh i know theres a lot of religious issues and et cetera um but i im hoping that uh in a way people can can see that as a contribution then to the state um i did live in Ohio for a couple of years and i know thats how they kind of got around um you know having to uh taxes or increase in taxes was was by the lottery is that right yeah yeah yeah and and i know the people are concerned that its only gonna be the the lower you know income people who are actually going to you know be the the biggest participants in this um yeah so some of those folks probably say youre taxing them anyway then if youre dangling a lottery out there in front of them yeah yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and um i only saw it as being you know really positive and of course it you know was just a fluke if you won you know because i really never expected to win and and i never did the big big lottery were talking about uh but you know every once in a while id come up with two or three dollars or something but i felt good in the sense that i was really putting my money the way i felt it was back into uh the taxes uh and it went actually most of it went to the schools and uh to school reforms things like this so uh yeah i i saw it really as a positive thing yeah how do you feel about um federal services and things laughter you you know i was yeah what are what are the federal services what what do we i mean i know we got a big army and and you know uh i guess i guess they have matching federal funds for a lot of our state and local projects right well because i was looking at some of the services that i actually use now i did um uh way back when i did use government um things such as uh uh food stamp

yeah go ahead okay well um ive never ive didnt really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast laughter um i had been working parttime before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um my budgets kind of hasnt doesnt exist except for at certain times laughter you know right and you make more money but it goes away anyway right well i dont have to worry i mean i dont have to think ahead as much like you know but i havent really saved anything im still trying to uh ive i have school debts im still paying back and stuff yeah i have three children and a house so uh its a serious its a serious matter but uh my wifes just starting to go back to work maybe thatll take the oh okay so you have to budget pressure off but i must  i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i dont ive started keeping a budget on computer i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping wouldve helped and uh i still havent managed to uh uh do it the way i should yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your moneys going then you its its easier even if you dont stick to it i think it you know its better to have you a little bit more conservative hm right i believe if i had to that i could  estimate all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but im sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan  but but even if you cant i dont think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget its because i had too i knew exactly laughterwhere every penny was going before i had it but its its a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway but also it i think its bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know youre paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes ive looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children  what youre gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and thats uh you can fool yourself if you dont set that up somehow and thats hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated dont ever you know just just blow a little bit thats you know but youll find that the  kids dont really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so theyll ask for things pretty much constantly laughter right i remember doing that as a child laughter and ive i learned to say no pretty much constantly laughter and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month id feel better about it   yeah so who knows maybe thisll get me to do it laughter  you dont have children no i sure dont well thats a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them laughter oh i know i mean ive ive had i have a cat and laughterthats laughteryou laughterknow laughter thats well thats one solution laughter thats hard enough i mean i know but i mean you know thats a lot laughter some sort of you know when some theres times when i if i couldnt afford to buy myself groceries i would buy them for her first you know just because you i mean you feel a lot worse because this being is completely dependent on you you know thats an interesting spirit but and i suppose cats are like children they dont take no for an answer laughter as easily laughter  laughter well then  uh yeah they are a lot simpler but laughter but im im just saying you know i it it would it would be hard to know that someone elses life was completely dependent on you you know  yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what theyre gonna need in five or ten years  thats uh really difficult its hard to see that right now even though you know you have too yep  well ive made my confession laughter yeah im  im glad we had this conversation because it makes me think i need to sit down and laughter maybe write

 do you have any thoughts on company benefits i do but uh theyre pretty slanted i want you to know laughter im prepared laughter uh my company was bought by another company and the majority of us were laid off oh okay i see where this is laughtergoing uhhuh so you know uh what i would like to see well uh the really sad part of this is that im fifty five years old thats not that laughterbad beg your pardon thats not so sad oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim i was a systems analyst for an oil company and you know they just i mean Sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean im sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications for this type of work you know its just uh and i guess thats thats pretty farfetched as benefits go but gosh you know i saw it i was fixed for life laughter so uh i think more and more people are finding that out even people with state and and uh federal jobs it its a shock it really is it really is but uh i i think uh i guess my feelings on this are that the one of the most important benefits we currently have is our health insurance thats true and that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company isnt there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for eighteen months there is uhhuh and and thats fine but you know im still unemployed after about fourteen months okay oh yeah thats worrisome and when you switch yeah when you switch over the the premiums are really quite high and additionally ive had a heart attack so its going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now now with the political political situation the way it is i think thats going to change you talking about national health i think were going to have to have something of that sort so that will cease to be as important a benefit i think that well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are what are your feelings what what do you feel suing left and right and just driving these costs up well i agree with you but do you know thats thats what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates well i i have my own beef about health insurance i uh im not a spring chicken laughtermyself quite frankly um i raised a family and now id like to get back into my field which is teaching and its at a time where school budgets are so far down that theyre firing experienced people and also you know im im a art teacher which is a very small field out of a whole school theres two or three oh yes and you know there are two hundred apliplationsapplications for one one job uh you send in a resume and they they dont even write a letter to you to say no thanks which they they dont have time yeah i suppose and um i do substitute teach and my biggest complaint is schools get a discount insurance school districts because they have so many people why cant they allow their substitutes to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have and they wont let us well youve youve approached it yeah they dont let you do it what is their thinking on it uh um i dont know i dont know have they said i just i just know its not allowed okay have they said we cannot do this because yeah uh no not they they didnt get that far no because no because we we do we dont do this we dont do this and everybody thinks its sort of a crying shame i have been divorced and i knew that uh when i was divorced i was allowed that eighteen months of insurance on my exhusbands plan and i was allowed to pay for myself at their lower rate and i dont see what the school district would have to lose by letting us pay for ourselves but is uh lets see are they paying a part of the premium well i theyre paying all the premium for their fulltime teachers oh they are yeah yeah thats part of their salary and have you offered to come in and have you offered to come in and pay the whole premium and they still wont let you no no its just not policy thats crazy yeah that just doesnt seem to make any sense so what do you do about insurance well i am remarried now and my husband um quit his job to try some consulting hes an engineer and what he did was he joined you know if you join a group sometimes its a little less he joined the Engineers Society or some group like that and what he did which was actually very clever most people want to have ah yeah the lowest deductible and then get eighty percent of their money back and all of this my husband said why dont we take a five hundred dollar deductible if we have a little you know annual checkup here or there we can pay that thats not the problem

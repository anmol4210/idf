what what you have some ideas on the to help out the President here i think that uh one of the things theyre going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at whats important and what has a return on investment uh theres an awful lot of federal programs that uh they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good right i i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at and theres some things some programs that just dont seem to be working at all uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs theyre just seem to be self perpetuating and uh uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they dont have much interest and there is no uh uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesnt get continued theres theres a lot of waste as a result i think of that well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family so thats resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around well uh i and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing yeah i think theres uh theres a good opportunity if theyll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh if and combine the savings there with with the savings in all these uh give away programs and and then waste thats in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that dont do any good i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation well there was a there was a study i dont know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission I know that uh and it it he was uh a private uh individual and he did a study on on cutting waste out of government and he came up with i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on well i know that uh well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator and work out a a one or two page cost proposal and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and thats the same in government i guess its is it all necessary you know and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does uh and i i think one of the problems were having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh but but when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor and now it seems like theres uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers yeah well and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and thats something the government has never really tried hard to do uh they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have uh theres no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when youre going into debt to do it and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things uh we have a a new sewage treatment facility near here thats uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water and they have an administrative building associated with it that uh has

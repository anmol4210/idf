 here we go Jay all right uh can you give me your ideas on uh what you think about the budget well on the budget im not for sure i wouldnt um start off first of all by putting a limit on the members of congress and then maybe we could get some new people in there to work on it but other than the budget i think they just have to uh i dont know i think they have to just have uh maybe um uh almost a like a constitutional convention and get sharp people from all over the country to come together try to decide what were going to cut i think we cut the wrong areas and and just maybe start all over again almost like family sometimes i have to do this call time out and then yeah vocalizednoise i guess some of the states had had started started out like uh  California i think i think they had is it proposition two and a half they had out there and Massachusetts had the same type of of uh legislation you know they only can raise taxes so much there theres a cap on it see down here in Texas they just they dont state they we dont have a state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the fees they just call them fees and theres a fee for everything you dont have a state income tax we dont have a state income tax and uh theres no uh the sales tax isnt on food is that right or anything like that so we yeah our sales tax isnt either uh its a yeah so were not taxed very much uh but the fees are pretty pretty ridiculous but i think we just may need to have uh you know get sharp people from all over the country into some sort of a like a constitutional convention and then to say whats working in one place why wouldnt it work someplace else i noticed Bridgeport Connecticuts declared bankruptcy laughter yeah isnt that something uh yeah it was just in the paper the last day or two yeah yeah so yeah and it happened i think Michigan way back in the late sixties when Soapie Williams was governor they declared bankruptcy the whole state of Michigan so its yeah its just theyre just running um i i dont know about about Texas but i know up around here as soon as uh like Massachusetts well Rhode Island too it doesnt make any difference which state when things get tight they always threaten theyre going to cut uh police fire uh theyre going to layoff teachers but they vocalizednoise its the rank and file they never talk about cutting at the top you know the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant oh absolutely absolutely absolutely and i think the federal government is the same way that its its just gotten so huge that i dont think anyone has got a handle on it anymore no by leaving  theres no  yeah yeah by leaving that particular group in there to make the decisions its not going change so somebody has to get it to where that its just a rank and file citizens around the country and and the and like a thats right thats true yeah like a huge convention you know if theyd send uh so many people from each uh um they could do them they could do them in the state by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at uh political conventions um yeah but youd what what it would end up it would be the same old people going so thats vocalizednoise probably there should be uh uh a mandatory limit on on how long you can serve like maybe only two terms  yeah thats ive always thought that vocalizednoise and thats if we you know because some of these old boys have been in there for a thousand years get in get in there forever and then that seniority system and then the  some creep in there and uh so um yeah its probably going to have to start there and get some new blood in there and then um maybe they can look at it and they can you know each one of them thats in there now have got their own favorite projects and all you know theyre theyre cronies and  um but i dont think you can do anything i dont think theyre i think the budgets out of hand until you can get in there and change the administration and im talking about right through from top to bottom right i think uh well even at the beginning of the country Alexander Hamilton wanted to put a limit on um the the President was only supposed to serve seven years and they didnt uh they didnt follow through on that but i ive ive thought about a twelve year cap for  congressmen and senators and maybe go back to a seven year term for the President sort of you know  vocalizednoise it so it would run could you hold one second just a second Ray  yeah thats all right my wifes a psychologist and i thought that might be somebody calling in for her oh i see how are things in Massachusetts after Dukakis then um Massachusetts Massachusetts is in is in terrible terrible shape theyre uh uh theyre still talking about uh uh laying laying off a lot of people you know cutting cutting a lot of services um the state is not funding any of the any of the cities and towns so so the cities and towns now are are forced to go out and uh raise capital uh its its uh yeah this is Texas is trying its just a bad situation and its not only there but Rhode Island is the same its just isnt there you know its in the same boat oh thats crazy because Texas uh it looks like its trying to bounce back a little bit but its weve still got a ways to go its uh i teach in a college and i and im in a im in pretty good shape but some of these uh theres just a lot of people out of work lot of homeless and the budget is just i dont weve got a new governor democratic democratic governor female and uh shes trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and thats the problem is that you if you come in too fast you cant get reelected yeah you know um theres an awful lot of people uh in this country that are idle uh when you say like the homeless and theres the prison population is skyrocketing uh i think they should probably go back and borrow some of uh Roosevelts ideas you know uh set up some of these CCC camps like they had way back yes yes but um that you know give people a little uh dignity because i know a lot of these people would like to work they just dont know how uh to go out and get find a job or theyre not skilled or or something and it  it doesnt take a lot of skill to rake leaves or do some of those things like those  thats right they could they could uh they could build roads uh bridges uh uh canals uh theres theres a ton of things they can do we can take in uh they could stop start uh a rapid transit right right uhhuh  movement like when they when they first broke into uh  uh the interstate highways uh we dont have a rapid transit system in this country though worth a worth a damn no we dont we dont  the um we and you mentioned the prison prison population another thing you can do in the budget weve got a lot of people who dont need to be in prison i mean theres some of the lesser crimes anymore probably you dont need to put them away put them in some work program  thats true right  yep you know a minimum very minimum security and this theyve got a job and you you work uh you know work this long some of them may find that they they like it and want to take it permanently then you could just switch them over in another branch of that and pay them um a decent wage you youd whatever youd pay them would be a lot better than having them in jail or having them out on the street thats right because i dont know what what it costs per year per inmate its a its a lot if they just if they just like paid them a wage and let them perform something useful

 uh guy uh some of my things i id like to have a short work week oh okay you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cause okay we can start off there lets just get started i dont wanna well you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it laughter  okay  so i just press one then right okay ready so so you think uh i i think vocalizednoise a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty seven hour work week how about you well right now im im just a student i only work part time but i ive work in the job force before and forty hours is just too long you just dont have any time to do anything it it seems like Saturday Saturday you you get off but Sunday youre getting ready for Monday and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well thatd happen is that for every four people wed give another job vocalizednoise uhhuh and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market wed have uh more recreation people would have time to do it thered be less of a stress level wed have less wed have less crime wed have to wed have to build less prisons wed need you know less police force yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time its not clear in that it it thats thats thats a thats a possibility one of one of the problems theyre facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance is that the small businesses cant afford cant offer us health insurance and it it its too costly and then what is what is happening is that theyre on um a policy where they have so X amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and and and things like that what happens and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular its called a a group well whatll what happens then is that they cancel because they just cant cancel the indivigalindividual so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people dont have any insurance coverage but im im you know im im satisfied with my job im im an engineering student and i work for my instructor and im im not a typical student im im older im im in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token its a really really enjoyable for me because i dont have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and one of the things that i i really hate about jobs i dont i dont like bosses that that you know wanna yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i i just really cant deal with that so yeah uh what kind of what kind of jobs have you done well i do work uh research in computer science and ive just been doing that for a few years now so i my job has most of the benefits i want um what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as id like but uh you know thats just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of uh they also a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education like i i get night courses that theyre theyll cover right now and thats really good yeah thats great you have what you might call knowledge power you know when when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that youre categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist but if youre a person thats doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system youve revised and revamped the system well then youre youre vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so thats where im that im i like im into computers too and thats one of the things that ive found in in any one one of these jobs and anything ive done is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge youre youre not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway but what i

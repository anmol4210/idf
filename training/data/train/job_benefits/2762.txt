um you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for um job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director and i mean its just its theres so much opportunity in a larger company to uh stay within the same company so youre not losing your seniority level but um just to try new things and and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if if you switched companies sometimes well yes you have an opportunity to  to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system its most companies most big companies have that but well i think sometime that you get lost in that also uhhuh uhhuh i really do i i i sometimes think that a small company may offer well im not sure how to put laughter well uhhuh im not sure how to put this but thats not uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise but the competition is much greater for that uhhuh well its true yeah opportunity okay there is a very uh uh at least in my office and i know thats not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office when youre with a small company i think youre right you could be even uh you can be a big person in a small company you know exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever youd care to call it and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous with the consequences of that because people do the best they can uhhuh sure and often times its not really what was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is um do you feel working working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and im you know its one of these put out fires things  so i can see the results of that i see yeah laughter but um yes i im i i get a lot of gratification from my job but some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever i i vocalizednoise but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh i i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but its nice if you can be enjoying it you know while youre doing it yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments im a im an instructor there so i teach new well not new employees but all yeah all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people to to become what we call automation specialists and and its a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job and then you would come to one of our inhouse classes that is great on on company time oh really and and and or on overtime so we dont involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week for automation specialist training that is wonderful when you finish hopefully youve acquired enough knowledge to uh you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and and and that thats really gratifying to me i i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say ive no i dont know a hammer from a a nail or a wrench laughteri laughtermean you know and okay thats and thats where well start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people uhhuh laughter uhhuh well coming in and and top notch uh mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of come they they jump right on it uhhuh uhhuh that is great and that is so smart because with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated youre just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need no thats a fact and i mean you just dont find them and it its such such a great way take the people that you already have and train them and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more uhhuh uhhuh okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job im that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they uhhuh exactly and then they had word processors and now theyve got full blown desk top publishers so you know oh my oh exactly i mean its incredible it is i im that amazes me that you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and and its i its you know they use laser printers and all that and its absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that uhhuh uhhuh but i i was in the same situation i had to learn i i had no knowledge of a computer at all im a master mechanic but not a computer expert but now im in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that oh thats great that is fabulous but um you know another benefit that that i wish i had more of and who wouldnt is vacation time you know um i think that uh when when youre working and an especially i dont know i mean every job you you say how youre constantly putting out fires you know i i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it just yeah i i i feel that way and its a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year yeah yeah exactly right and then if you have extra days out for what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it its penalized against your merit increases and et cetera oh wow so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days of what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis right uhhuh for some unusual circumstances but to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time its hard is that uh what your company policy is too well no it well in some instances yes okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then its two weeks after a year or so but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years its four weeks oh my goodness but thats still thats a long time you know but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation i was just talking to somebody about this today its funny it takes you until Tuesday or Wednesday to really wind down oh sure vocalizednoise you know to say okay i i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you dont have to be worrying about something you know i think uh i would like to see i would like to see more its like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or something and they find that thats much better for them than having the whole summer off an where theyre completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry really would really thats true benefit from that im not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so thats a problem you know thats a problem pardon me yeah well thats where temporaries come in laughter they could hire temporaries to fill in well yes thats and thats exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so we we put a lot of school um like a coop type thing for the summer pardon me like a coop for the summer almost yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on fulltime and theyve uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know theyre familiar to our uhhuh uhhuh our ways and stuff and theyre on our records and we find that thats very very helpful yeah i that is and uh it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations you sound uh like a very young person im twenty five

all right yes yes i think were terribly taxed i i think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats and i dont think theres a change between one party than the other uh i think we get get a lot back but not as much as we should uh i guess what i feel about it is that its so mismanaged that it theres got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it its just its ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into action action the the Gramm the Gramm Rudman what is it uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that thats exactly what they needed to do to get their act together the Gramm the Gramm Rudman Act yeah yeah well i think they spend too much they they spend too much on themselves too the the oh yeah i think so too a lot of the the taxes gets back to the the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than yeah well things like mailings they dont use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they dont they dont try to uh to conserve no youre right and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and i mean when i dont have money i dont buy something yeah no i think uh it it is the the Congress and them just dont have any interest in saving us money uh they sure dont seem to the national debt is terrible uh therere a couple of things i think we need to really work for and i dont know quite how to do it but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they dont have to spend so much time doing everything if its a good idea it can be done again oh yeah you know and if its not so what at least you havent thrown out all the work theyve done for months and months and months and months yeah i saw one on Twenty Twenty uh about a month ago i guess whereas one i think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that maybe it was uh Connecticut im not sure one of the small states up there where he had a bill through for another um a drug agency that would be located there and he was the only one that wanted it it was going to cost millions of dollars the drug agency didnt want it and he was going to build it in his home town and they were going to hire a lot of people and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing and and you know they they asked him about it and yeah this is thats right do you really need this this is going to cost a lot of money oh yes we need it but do you know that the drug agency doesnt want this and they do things that are you know just like the uh yeah thats just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on and the trouble is you dont you have so little input about it you dont know enough yeah that to know what what to do about some of this stuff i right yeah theyre supposed to do what we say but they do what they they want to do really yeah thats right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i i just cant believe there arent other people out there that could do just as well as what weve got absolutely absolutely we need to get that through we we have said that ive said it several times on different subjects about the government that two year two terms is enough for all of them uh whether youre mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly President that uh two terms is plenty yeah i think thats right and then we get these professionals out of there and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us yeah wouldnt that be too bad well thats right i think i dont know i think uh people in general the the the the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that its not hardly you know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere until we cant weve just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know well its so much money and you cant even add it up you know thats why they think its vocalizednoise no you cant even cant even conceive of what theyre talking about yeah when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know yeah yeah i mean it just and and you just the other thing is its its all very well to give money to help people other people and i think we need to do that but there are they need to put more limits on them they need to restrain about what they do foreign aid yeah foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless its absolutely necessary they theyve given that away for fifty years i i you know i think thats probably unless unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again i agree i agree you know i dont really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing thats thats just uh eating us up you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family wed be up before the the magistrate laughter for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and its all right yeah i i know were taxed to death on every every thing i dont know whats the best way to do it but uh they dont even talk about that they just raise it they dont even consider it like you saying is to cut something back you know yeah thats true well sounds like they are at least doing something now with the uh the military you know theyre cutting some of that but of course now you know TI you know thats hurting us but although yeah its good to see them doing some things there anyway TI has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else and if theyll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic uh weapon systems but uh thats the only good that ive seen Congress do you know and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody uh i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens were going to have to bite the bullet and were all going to have to do it i it just isnt fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere yeah yeah thats why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into action into action and show they mean business that theyve got to cut theyve got to cut costs yeah the only taxes i think that are well spent well not the only but uh i think the now i i dont understand the present school thing but uh i have two daughters ones in college already and ones about uh to be in high school but uh i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i dont mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know yeah i think thats right well i dont i dont really mind paying taxes for for positive things that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things but um you know it you just feel like its out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than theyre doing the spending is out of control yeah oh i agree with you so its i i think thats a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh well i think thats right if they dont do if they dont if they dont pull it in and start doing something i think theyre really going to have to i think i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that what they did last election and uh ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes you know theyre supposed to represent us thats what theyre called but they dont yeah yeah maybe maybe maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are yeah in some ways were awful lucky i guess there a lot of lot of places where its worse than it is here but i know but it still you dont want it to get that bad good heavens no thats right you dont want to uh you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i dont really mind paying taxes but i would just like to know that theyre not being foolishly spent that theyre doing something thats positive for for somebody i dont really feel like uh i dont really feel like i use taxes laughtervery laughtermuch laughteri dont know maybe i do more than i i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh yeah thats youre right well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex uh in the last say twenty five years or so maybe longer theyve built all these dams you know the Corps of Engineers have uh soon as they finish a lake theyll go at get another one and that we havent had uh weve had droughts here in long summers weve had good water supply and thats due to the Corps of Engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know yeah theyve done some good things the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago uh Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that bout what they had done and they they really had done some good some good work yeah i think anything for water supply like vocalizednoise California should do more of that too yeah there are a lot of places places where theyre in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they dont take if they dont take that early stand right they just finished Joe Poole Lake over here and they need to start another one i think every time they finish one they ought to just have another one in line the waters critical yeah thats probably right the growth is fast enough so that they cant afford to just dawdle and wait until something until they need them well its good to talk to you okay yeah how many calls have you made oh about nine oh yeah im up to twenty are you a TIer no i just vocalizednoise just a housewife

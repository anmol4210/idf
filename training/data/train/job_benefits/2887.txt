well i think health care is real important and dental coverage but i guess medical insurance is probably what i consider the second most important yeah i agree on that and you know it seems paid compared to what we our salary is versus what our health care is our health care keeps increasing increasing increasing and not to the same rate as our pay laughter right right i know no matter what you do about that yeah unless youre like a Senior VP or something which i am not laughter yeah i know its um i dont know and then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people right me either  um expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level you know theyll say maybe well pay you X amount annually but then we you know ten percent to fifteen percent more is are your benefits and if youre like are you married um like my husband works and i do so i dont take some of i have certain things that i take and he has other things he takes so i mean in that kind of situation its really almost redundant you know so that some of the benefits i would rather have um uhhuh yeah money instead i mean yeah more money actually um or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know right i feel same way actually um we dont use any of TIs benefits other than i i buy bonds and  and um thats it because you dont use the you dont use the medical insurance you use your your companys not at all my my husbands yes we use my husbands but he he works for Bramalea Company and they pay one hundred percent where does he work if you dont mind me not one dime is deducted from his check oh youre kidding whats the name of that laughtercompany what do they do laughter Bramalea its a security company and and building they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings  and uhhuh are they a big company or yeah actually theyre from Canada theyre Canada based uhhuh thats see thats probably why because Canadian Canada has the the um government run health care systems social medicine and you dont pay them and if you live there its like Europe you dont pay a dime right right yeah its all taken care you know thats wonderful yeah but vocalizednoise our prescriptions and everything our visits to the doctor our hospitalization the only thing we pay for is if if something happened emergency and we had to have an ambulance its twenty five dollars  laughter yeah if i were him id tell him make sure he stays there laughter i mean thats nothing compared really yeah well at TI i was getting for the both of us it was like seventy five dollars a month oh my goodness you know deducted for an HMO yeah yeah i dont work at TI my husband works at TI but um i work at EDS but its like um uh you know theyre both bacallybasically EDS is a little bit better than TI but um and we take my dental my my dental his medical and the medical is just i mean i think its terrible you know its eighty twenty but theyre then theyre getting ready to change it again for Aetna um i dont know i just dont think companies um they want you to feel responsible and dont abuse the medical system and you know um TI just did the thing where with the smoking premiums we dont smoke but did you do you know about the smoking premiums yeah do you guys smoke oh yeah i mean oh yeah yeah we dont either neither one of us do but then you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for TI too and she said what about the people that are walking around and i hope uh i dont you dont sound like youre in this category but i mean for extremely obese people or something the kind of people that cant sit in the airline airplane chair you know you know whos going to croak first the people that smoke or you know seems like an unnecessary penalty yeah i mean im not all for smoking at all but i just you know i dont know how they can do it umhum exactly yeah exactly you cant charge more for a person whos on a flight just because theyre larger yeah  vocalizednoise blanket yeah umhum or something yeah its like stupid but thats why im not a boss i laughterguess laughter i dont know laughter yeah i mean i dont know um what other what other type of benefits do they have that i mean Canadian based companies vocalizednoise companies they have to be a little bit different than the American then yeah they are as far as their like pension plans i think theyre vested a lot earlier i think at TI its what five years yeah TI is at least five years yeah yeah five to seven and theyre vested after their first year totally totally vested and they have the K and the usual benefits like that uh oh my goodness thats kind of nice yeah TI has that but thats a pretty standard thing anymore you know um your husbands company probably matches more than TI though right right no they match the same amount yeah well they match four percent which is the same you know fifty percent or four percent oh they do okay but thats yeah it is thats still pretty good though i mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension yeah i know um EDS has eight years i think EDS has seven to to eight years so its like TI in that respect you know and and i mean and im working for a company thats making money laughter you know EDS has a cash flow problem as they say but um not EDS TI um yeah yeah but i i dont know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire some uh vocalizednoise people the grunts as i call them like laughtermyself to tell them yeah i mean i dont know but if i were to rank them i guess i would say next to income its really just health benefits and then um for most people i know it would be day care like TI has no day care yeah that and i know thats a big issue because i i belong to a womens forum group and some of the questions were getting are are on site day care and things like that that they consider a very serious benefit and i cant tell you anybody right now at TI thats uh considering that oh i dont i would think so yeah because my husband yeah they really should because theyre big enough um so  they should be though and the other thing i think is really good is that EDS is much better than TI at i think right now that that we have day care um they uh the health the health the health program like TI has Texans but it i dont think it that its uhhuh right developed as much as it could be for the size company as TI i mean if you ever walked into EDSs health quote unquote health clubs on site laughter and you walk into Spring Creek well Spring Creeks better than the one on Dallas Parkway but i mean yeah but yeah a lot better EDS is much is better than Spring Creek  yeah oh its really nice yeah you know instead of like six um treadmills youve got like twenty laughter and EDS cant even compare in size oh man oh yeah in terms of the number of employees so i so i dont know i guess its just where they um and like EDS reimburses you for adoption people yeah oh i see right and TI doesnt have anything like that you know so i guess i i wish the companies like TI and a lot others were more progressive in that respect so thats good thats a fortunate thats a fortunate benefit you know that theyre so active for their employees yeah yeah and theres i mean they have some strange things i mean they have very strange like dress codes and you know um umhum um you cant wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless youre in a you you know but it just doesnt there arent manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is um i dont know i i guess i also wish that uh companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews me too uh me too because you know with utilities and and homes that are uh price of homes has went up drastically drastically like an average house is now a hundred thirty thousand oh just yeah exactly and and that is unreal because weve got people out here that are just  poverty level but then we got these million dollar homes so you know where do you find a happy medium and how does your salary deal with that its not its just not doing it i know i know umhum and i mean i mean i dont know how you and your husband are too but i mean we have friends that laugh at us and we i clip coupons and i said hey ill probably do this even if im a millionaire which i wont ever be but i mean its like because you just cant i mean it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something laughteryeah laughteryeah well the car insurance is due laughter i mean its yeah its kind of i know i dont know what were going to do laughterabout laughterit yeah you want to rob a bank no i didnt say that laughter i didnt say that on this line laughter thats true that is exactly where we are thats so strange  common problem common problem laughteryeah laughterreally i dont know what else about corporate benefits i cant think its probably been too hot today for either of us to um kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas usually people are all over the country yeah and i think Dallas as far as um economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is um this is true so were somehow were better off than a lot of them umhum and that doesnt doesnt make it any better its just i guess something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um thats what i want that uh you know people are lucky to have jobs and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits no laughter when you see people that dont have um anything but HMOs or you know i mean really cant even afford to get in a job that costs like we had a guy fixing our air conditioner and he said he didnt even make ten dollars an hour and he has three kids and i went oh you know that has to be rough but benefits i dont know i guess i guess one thing id like to see too and i i dont know how TI is about this but id like to see um employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their um the execution of their job yeah empowerment issue  you know right yeah thats a good word for it um how is TI in that mode well very well um its slow though i think at least theyre making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and cultural change within the management first and now its kind of filtering down to the peon level but uh i think theyre really trying its going to take years though i mean its just its that mindset all part of a good old boy network yeah umhum has to change yeah  yeah EDS is oh theyre better but theyre a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do theyre pretty much put the if thats where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know theyre kind of formula oriented doesnt want to change yeah and and you cant really argue with them because theyve always been successful so you know what can you tell them laughter really well i guess thats what i know about benefits okay laughter okay yeah me too good good talking to you thanks okay byebye you good talking to you and uh keep cool okay byebye

 okay are you a TIer is somebody in your family a TIer no uh my fiancee works for the computers for the government and thats how he got it oh okay so who do you work for i just graduated from college so you dont have any benefits at all to talk about youre just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits laughter or what im looking for oh okay okay well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers no huhuh didnt get that far you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get oh well well ill tell you a little bit about what TI has as benefits we do have uh like most companies we have medical insurance although theyre tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um set hospitals in the area they call it network hospitals theyre hospitals oh yeah ive heard of that yeah theyre hospitals that theyre uh agreeing with uh TI that theyll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep costs you know costs down now theyre going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors so its almost like a um uh an HMO you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isnt in the network then it will be less benefits that you get we have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like ive had a couple of crowns recently and if you didnt have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i pay yeah it can yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month because it always seems like if youre going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more um we do have pension although ive realized recently that the pension doesnt seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working youre not thinking about that oh i like to think about laughterthat after youve been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all thats in there i dont thinks its going to pay too long when i get out um we do have a new thing that theyve started a few years ago um its not an i R A its called a four oh one K plan its kind of like pension you put in so much money and then TI um meets you half way up to a certain maximum so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents so that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan course you can buy stock in the company but you know thats not always a real for sure kind of thing course not always safe laughter yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down i dont know if its any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like you know last year it was forty dollars a share and now this year its thirty six dollars a share and you go gee im losing money laughter doesnt quite feel as good umhum yeah and we get you know vacation normally after youre here for six months and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you and its one nice thing about TI is after youve been here uh for five years you get three weeks umhum oh thats nice a lot of places make you work like ten years or so before you get that much yeah uhhuh and we get some we get uh decent holidays um we at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend and at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas they float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on so thats nice so you always get two days at Christmas a lot of people just take you know that week i normally take that week somehow you know you only have to take three days of vacation and you get the whole week at Christmas time yeah well um i can just tell you like you know from my dad and my fiancee like my dad well theres twelve kids in my family whoa okay so uh the the dental was very important you know to my dad but um i think they took the dental away now he worked for United Telephone System its you know its just another you know telephone network and they took the dental away but now i think theyre going to start getting into eye oh yeah yeah i think uh um i dont use the services but yeah i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage you get discounts on uh glasses and im not quite sure theres certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that yeah and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock but my fiancee hes on that same kind of pension as what you said only for everything he puts in theyll match it up to a certain amount like if he puts in a dollar theyll put in a dollar you know and then hes only allowed i think i dont know if its maybe five percent or something like that that hes allowed to put in and theyll match it so and um he works for the did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards okay well he works for them they changed their name now but thats thats where he works and um he his vacation is really nice hes going to be there three years at the end of this month and hell be getting three weeks vacation gee thats pretty decent yeah yeah okay you know of course its its for the government and he has all the holidays off right and you get some extra ones federal workers always seem to get you know you get Columbus Day and Veterans Day and those ones that you couldnt really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow yeah uhhuh he has it really nice its nice where he works and um he seems to be very happy you know like his hospitalization and you know he has all that and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any oh yeah okay but you have to go you know to certain ones but still that works out really nice you know yeah were doing an HMO right now um and when we go to get prescriptions its five dollars so but so you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes vocalizednoise which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better um you thats like a buck a capsule thats not bad either so if youve got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five its a pretty good savings then theres other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldnt cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow so it isnt a percentage but sometimes you work you know you manage to make

 oh i guess i started it oh okay bust away so uh where you from just in general oh um New York New York okay im in New Jersey uhhuh vocalizednoise okay so uh i guess were talk about taxes uh so what do you yeah well yeah i know i pay too much you pay too much yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just proportional im im viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage and on the bad years im not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i dont pay below average oh are you like a small business or something or yeah yeah im a consultant oh okay you know so due to the nature of the business it um you know my base line is average and i dont get that back on the other half back isnt it their like vocalizednoise um income averaging or something like that there was that went away a few years ago oh okay laughter and uh you know whatever you call it i suspect that was one of those loop holes for the wealthy they closed laughter but uh i dont know for sure so why why do you think you dont get uh anything enough for your value i mean well i didnt say value um im just saying that proportionally i pay this portion in a large amount oh you a single uh no not at the moment not at laughterpresent uh i know singles pay more than married people yeah yeah yeah and im single i know that and i pay quite a bit higher than a married person well thats where if you dont happen to buy a house or something like that yeah if youre unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesnt and you dont uh make it desirable yeah thats about the only uh tax uh write off you can get these days yeah yeah well unless youre up in the uh mega bucks range well yeah buy a yacht or something laughter but um but i guess they took away that and theyre yelling and screaming about that yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh Washington DC awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something umhum yeah you know so uh you know whats going in has got to be a lot more than going out if it can pay for all that stuff well it depends if its you know a a regressive tax or a progressive tax well im not really talking about um who is putting it in im just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things well no yeah in the middle yeah thats what i meant borrowed time actually could be could be borrowed time its like whats that well you know its just uh you know pass a law print up another billion and uh i dont know i i business as laughterusual uh i dont know uh here in New Jersey we have taxes for just the necessities and i think its uh regressive tax its just as worse im not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean progressive um its its like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you dont really need that extra income to survive you know and so the idea idea behind that is to to you know thats why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least supposedly well thats the theory um you know thats what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat flat percentage tax um across the board and even and even tax people for things that they need to live so if you tax you can tax uh you know medicine or food and and yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it working it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and theres a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities im sorry only not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container its not taxed but if you buy it in a can reconcentratedconcentrated uh concentrated then it is taxed so um i dont claim to understand that laughter you know thats um and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and yeah sin taxes hope people will stop yeah but you know we you dont need cigarettes or or um alcohol to live liquor yeah thing is you know you got to look all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people laughter well its to a degree if uh you know if youre addicted its not going to matter but um certainly it it depends i mean here you in New Jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities so things you need to heat your home the things that drink your water you tax water laughter its crazy um you know you you see what you its got to go somewhere so you got tax for that every utilitys thirteen thirteen percent you know i um we get a tax here that um what do you call it uh

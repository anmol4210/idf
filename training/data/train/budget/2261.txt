first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments now dealing on the federal level two percent two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because theyre actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product or their or their gross national product or profit okay profit rather im not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what youre saying if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent if their gross national profit say a million dollars then pay five five percent of that seems fair to me laughter also individual level but the um overall it just seem like theyve modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is its definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people middle class and you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden well i am awfully bored with uh every every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft and so much misspending that that money doesnt necessarily go where its supposed to go uh i know you dont ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the welfare dollar needs to come back to to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesnt need that money when its directed from afar i think the chance for misspending is greater i i suppose im thinking more in terms i im not thinking in terms of increasing taxes im just thinking for a quick fix uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts thats never going to happen i know laughter thats well maybe thats what im saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though the one thing that i had thought about to help correct that problem youve got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington thats all they have ever done after theyve been there that long theyre so deep rooted with their the old boy network i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then theyve got to sit out one i think thats wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician i dont think we should ever give them a lifetime income but we do dont we laughteryes i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous theres they have locked their benefits in to the point that once theyve served two terms theyre on gravy train anyway yes i think youre right i dont think we should ever give them a lifetime thing and theyre the ones that have screamed so much much much about that dont want to increase taxes and they dont want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise it they dont they speak with fork and tongue dont laughterthey at least were in agreement on that arent we laughter im afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and im not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow i think eventually its going get to the point where theres going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what its finally come to were you getting so far down to where youre being taxed so far down where you cant even afford to change your mind its going to come to a point where the average American citizens say weve had enough how do they react then were prosecuted if we simply dont pay our taxes so im not real sure how you believe then that eventually therell be an overthrow we know communism doesnt work what do we do next well in the form of capitalism that weve got apparently thats not working real good either uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority saying speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess im saying were all selfish maybe not a case of everybody being selfish every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody elses yes thats true it doesnt seem to workout that way laughterthough laughterdoes laughterit i think that the lobbyist uh are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesnt seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe thats why corporate America gets away with what theyre doing because of the kickbacks and et cetera im a bit of a a pessimist i dont see a change in my lifetime im afraid youre younger perhaps you can foresee one i never put anything beyond as far as when itll happen that im not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt yes i think youre right im just saying that i dont think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system uh with the elected officials i im not sure that uh its working right now though it is the best system thats out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point absolutely laughter nice talking to you okay nice talking to you bye

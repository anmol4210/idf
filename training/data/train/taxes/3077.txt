Americans Americans like me and whether or not uh uh uh not i think that were paying too much taxes um that including taxes in general or income tax and um  the other thing was do we get what we pay for i mean what what is our what is our opinion on that so are you prepared to talk laughter let me push oh i guess so go by ear laughter let me push one here laughter okay um well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas its most interesting because were one of the few if i dont know of any other state um does not have a state income tax and so we dont have a state income tax but we certainly make up for it in other ways here um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent oh wow isnt that awful laughter how about you what do you have there uh we have a six percent sales tax uhhuh and you have state income tax also umhum yeah well its been people here have just have this um theyve been really holding out in the legislature and its starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i dont know if Texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually theyre going to have to do it but um do you think you pay too much there or how do you feel about that i dont mind my taxes as much as my social security oh really interesting uhhuh yeah yeah um the taxes i dont know i can deal with that because i know everyone else is paying in laughtertoo i guess you know yeah yes but uh oh i dont know uh the one thing that we dont have uh tax on clothes do you uhhuh um yes we do have tax on clothes thats what i thought i know New York has also has a sales tax on clothes and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that how interesting i guess i didnt realize that um we dont have tax on groceries for instance um no well we dont have it necessarily on food but then theres other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know right yes yes i should i shouldve um delineated yet your absolutely right its the food the consumable food parts that you know we dont have to pay tax on yeah yeah and you really have to watch your your um your bill sometimes i think um its real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries laughter and thats when it really starts to add on and um so um thats that is sort of a help but um i dont know its just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of of tax on uh any sale as far as im concerned um yeah that would uh its real interesting this last um tax season im a student and the last tax season i had a just a part time job helping out in a tax office and the woman that owned the office was saying shed had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax deduct yeah and uh you know if youre not a home owner its or if you havent sold property or uh have something major like that its hardly you know it its just not much else you can do and she said its really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts cant do oh really and see i take it she was an accountant cant do it any more laughter so yeah uhhuh i know well i i i also was a student i just graduated in May and um i graduated with a finance degree but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax laughter how interesting that was the big joke laughter oh gosh where did you go to school Clarion University uhhuh uhhuh well youre youre the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too im a graduate student having gone back after many years so um nevertheless i am a student and poor laughter so its uh um you know its been i i guess as far as people like uh our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with Americans with um college age students you know and and i there just i dont know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and uhhuh i think they should go back i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy oh yes absolutely yeah because uh it seems like you they still come out okay um you know uh they yeah yeah you know they always have the argument well you know well whos to say we dont work harder to get that you know well i kind of have my doubts laughter i dont care how much they take off of you you know youre still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i ive worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work yes seems that way yeah that the higher they get the you know at least i dont know it seems like um they must feel like theyre paid for all of the years of experience or um vocalizednoise or or something or just the title sometimes um and it it doesnt seem fair and i i know a lot of people do make money um you know in in good investments and things like that but i think thats a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a whole not a whole lot of work laughter laughter i agree with you i do think its a lot of luck and i dont like that part of the finance you know whatsoever i dont know but like what i was saying about the social security thats real you know it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes and then the more i think about it the more i think im paying in to something that i granted you know im paying for my grandparents but im never going to see that social security is going to be gone before i ever get any probably not yeah yes or whats left is not going to be worth anything um you know in terms of how you can actually use it right theyre going to pay me fifty dollars a month laughterwell yeah right but thats well and im sorry i put in much more than that you know thats right yeah yeah thats i havent heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it was that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just werent in existence and um then i it sort of calmed down i havent heard much lately but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years im sure that you have heard oh yeah yeah well um i dont know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of yeah yeah you you got to look to what they put you know you have decent roads at least laughter yeah you have to appreciate yeah what what you do get for them sometimes and um i guess its its worse you know id rather see be able see to control my money as much as i do with whats left over after taxes than to live in oh England or um some some countries where so much of it is socialized that you dont see any of that money at all thats true and so you know i guess its all relative laughter laughter its how you look at it too laughter yeah thats exactly right i like to instead of thinking how much you know that im paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you laughterknow thats right yeah and i

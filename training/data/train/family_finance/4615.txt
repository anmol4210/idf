um why dont you go ahead first okay um short term uh it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over so budgeting in the short term isnt too much of an issue because theres not that much uh extra to go around uh long term is something were starting  to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about uh gee shes eight now so i guess about ten years good heavens so were were starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement but with not a whole lot of discretionary money its kind of hard to figure out how to do it how about you thats kind of uh similar to what were doing is um budgeting you know month to month is uh kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and whats extra so thats kind of how we do it uh from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever um long term thats a little bit easier for us because uh with uh our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings K plans um that kind of vocalizednoise you know retirement plans that kind of stuff so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when its on the paycheck and you have to try and take out some of that money you always find something a little extra that youd like to get that month so uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because um its automatically taken out so uh that works out much better for us so thats kind of how we do it anyway but and the old uh if you cant see it then you cant spend it uh idea laughter laughterexactly laughterexactly and if you cant touch it you cant spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it youre going to get a penalty that kind of thing so it leads you to kind of say well im not going to take it out im going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way maybe for retirement youre going to have that money laughter left lets hope anyway so youll have that so thats kind of how we do it but ours is more like month to month too uh short term is to get things going so any way other than that uh is kind of how we do it so i dont know if were our time is up or what laughter theyll let us know laughter um theyll uh laughter yeah exactly we we actually do have some money in a K i just wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because i agree that its a an excellent way oh definitely definitely and uh it grows uh it it seems like at first youre not gonna see a big return but as the years go on if youre with the company for any length of time then it gets much better and uh so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way and theres other savings plans or other things that you can do automatic you know deposit from checks to where you dont see it and uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent its put into our savings account and we dont see it then it works out to where you know you dont look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and thats it so yeah checking accounts a very dangerous place for money to be im convinced yeah it its easy because you do spend it thats for sure like i said you know you kind of look at it uh you you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts arent the best for you know long term type of planning so and you dont get a good return on it anyway so yeah i guess there other than things like the stock market or mutual funds theres really not much of a return on anything these days exactly right now yeah its a bad time you know yeah the interest is so low i mean it its nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in CDs or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever exactly exactly you know we have some inlaws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them out of that because they got so low but uh yeah its it drops so your better bet is to uh try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh savings plan or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so yeah im im with a small company now and i hope that uh if were successful that theyll go in for some sort of profit sharing thatll be very nice oh thats great yeah well i guess were kind of running out of steam on this topic here laughteryeah laughterexactly

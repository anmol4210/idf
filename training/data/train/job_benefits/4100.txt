uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because im now in the middle of a job search graduating here and realizing that one of the things thats not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will have some set of benefits where ever shes working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental its something that ive been uh looking for thats true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits uh even though you could you might never have any need for them uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesnt matter that youre single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears and uh laughter its that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me thats amusing laughter yeah yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you cant issue health insurance that doesnt have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and uh drug treatment yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah thats the same thing here even if youre and the result is a lot of people wont provide it at all or over charge even if youre a Mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you laughterknow uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh uh if you if you have a a full gamut of of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company vocalizednoise is willing willing to pay for but that youre simply not interested in and what you rather prefer to do is say dont get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other onell pay for the medical instead its its very much designed towards self only insurance i dont know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are yeah i think that uh a a lot of them are that way they uh they they deal they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness whos the primary carrercarrier and whos the secondary carrier but um uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and its very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month well thats pretty good it is im very pleased uh i think uh very pleased with the benefit package that we have that has uh uh a dental check ups are completely covered um theres a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know go work further on a degree or or get a masters degree of something uh uh course thats something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research so in fact youre saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits and wont take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor youre saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that um one thing i was wondering is something ive noticed that that they dont publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort yeah we dont have that either uh in in some ways i think its it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and and uh advice just by picking up the phone or without having to actually uh you know pay somebody extra

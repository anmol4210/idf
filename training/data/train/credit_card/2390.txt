okay um do you have a credit card oh laughter who doesnt have credit laughtercards i know ive got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one i dont know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right up and now ive after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and im still paying it off oh i know its its Christmas is the worst time for i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible i dont know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is its a pain paying it off oh yeah uhhuh i i dont i dont know um i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and ive put saved up enough money where im going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there oh thats good thats really good yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars oh i know i know but um i dont know i never i never liked loans a lot so im not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards and theyve just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them its it its just unreal i guess i know its easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things oh yeah it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you dont dont really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes oh of course even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know you got to be they say you have to dress for success laughter yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time you know uh get please get get get and youre already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff you know they just try to uh to to get you to get uh have their credit card and um you know uh six half a dozen isnt enough laughter laughter how many credit cards do you have oh i have one we well we have we have one one Master Card thats pretty good yeah my oh my husband wont even put his name on it i dont believe in those its like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it yeah laughter because youve got to have a credit card to rent a car yes you do uhhuh yes you do yes you do and that that uh down here uh you have to have a credit uh you just cant live without it because down here they dont take a check unless you got credit card and drivers license identification yep thats right up here at some stores if its if youre not in your home town you have to show them a credit card yeah uh its its just a another form of identification you know just to well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if thats why theyre taking it i mean i dont know how fair that is oh yes oh yeah they can but i dont know um yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent uh theyre all well ours is ours is through our our credit union and its thirteen so its yeah thirteen thats not bad thats not thats really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme high its its uh and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express youre really its not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that its really expensive isnt it is it i i dont know we dont uh we dont ive never had one my husband has one for to for uh for business its a company card but hes never had to use it so we dont get any get anything uh for it thats good laughter i mean we we we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but but so far hes never had to use it so we dont know anything about the billing yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month do they uh uh ooh laughter yeah because its uh that could get you in awful lot of trouble laughter i know especially if your uh your reimbursement didnt come through laughter from your company because i know they i dont know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and you can use that i dont know why you cant use other credit cards for business that way i dont i dont know i think its uh just a lot of companies prefer American American Express yeah i i dont know if its easy for them to get or or or what but um uh but i guess its its run so much different from the other ones yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards vocalizednoise you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa yeah laughter i bet you there i bet you there are people that do that oh i i im sure there are i mean uh laughter you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other you take oh gee oh gee oh they i think they charge more for cash advances so do they um its its some cards you you can do that and some cards you cant down here i think it just depends on what the what the banks will take well it yeah you cant get cash advances oh so on on uh on some cards uhhuh well i saying through my bank vocalizednoise they they since they have their own card they dont like to give advances through other for other cards oh well no uh it laughter i think thats a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually that that doesnt solve anything no it doesnt that just laughter laughter be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back yeah vocalizednoise because its still there laughter its just some place else laughternow i know i dont credit cards almost seem unfair to a person whos whos got a victim of impulse buying oh yeah store credit cards like unfair advertising or something store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa because i i had a i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent oh wow so i i cut i cut that thing up laughter so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders oh really yeah its its the thing if if a business is taking a credit card theyre really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends because it is a four percent that they take uh i didnt know three or four percent i dont know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank i used to take it off the deposit oh how awful vocalizednoise you do have to take it off your deposit yeah so it is a a service that theyre offering yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist i i know should own stock there instead of these uh uh banks going that are folding but well but everybodys really trying to you know its become a real national problem credit card debt and and i weve really cut i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars its got to be billions of dollars it it is it is it they uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt and what theyre talking about is credit cards thats uh probably true i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan and then theres all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards i dont know if they count uh mortgages as personal debt thats personal vocalizednoise maybe they dont i dont im not sure that they do i think uh what theyre talking about like vocalizednoise is uh credit cards and other junk vocalizednoise and loan car loans things like that because uh boy i know people who kids people right out of college the credit card people like to get you because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real laughtertrouble i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken confiscate her credit cards vocalizednoise i mean i dont know its probably theyre always saying the women are doing vocalizednoise are the spending ones but i havent heard one uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man laughter well i dont know um i i definitely want to get mine up mine paid off month to month like i used to and just as soon as i get it paid off ill probably get laid off laughter terrible cant afford my credit card anymore oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic

 not very laughtergood laughterits laughternot laughterbeen laughtera laughtergood laughterday i went  i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon i dont know i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn so i hope shes turned it in laughter are you eating i just  go ahead ill stop eating i just barely got home from the university i just barely got home from the university no its okay say what tell you what we can do is uh i can punch the uh one then we after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want laughter laughter okay go ahead fire away uh i love the irony of uh talking about this subject on April the fifteenth but um im afraid im im im probably in the minority i i actually dont think that we uh pay too much in this country um um particularly uh in this part of the country where um i guess i agree with you i do have a uh a bone to pick with um uh the way taxes are distributed um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal form and the sales tax cant i think thats regressive and uh its kind of dumb i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but then on the other hand i dont mind that its only on you know things that arent like  groceries and that its not on them well i mean nobody taxes groceries do they where oh yeah they do in Arizona is that right we have a pretty low income tax i mean pretty low tax rate here oh i think that the sales tax they just got to do something about it right its but thats the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes right  but i guess when i hear when when i see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven you know if you compute it as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well theres theres theres no other country thats that is taxed as low as we are well and i still think having lived in Europe for awhile you know  the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it im im not sure i understand what you mean well i mean i think i was in Germany you know for several years  and id a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have than have to live there  oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher uh yeah i suppose thats true yeah um probably more less so now than it was ten years ago or whenever but higher taxes yeah still is that way to some extent  i think the other problem is you know its its easy to complain about taxes because theyre something you theoretically can do something about but i look for example and you youre not in the quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world i wish i didnt have to pay  any more for for to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes yeah since uh i send my kids to parochial school thats uh yeah that thats probably a little tougher on you its not its not quite the bargain that laughtera laughterguy laughterwould laughterthink  but i mean i pay them gladly thats a decision i think its a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money but uh i mean thats uh thats the way the Americans want to interpret it i guess thats all right but yeah i and if i were uh when i was single and again when im retired i will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good thats always been a high priority you know no i think thats just you though i do think yeah thats true i think in places i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun they people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they cant get the tax bill passed no matter what happens and uh  there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they cant get anything done that seems um um like a cultural lapse i mean people were always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they of course i think with the graying of America were gonna see that problem in lots of places right yeah people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools laughter because it means more to them but i think its sad or build roads selfish and shortsighted yeah

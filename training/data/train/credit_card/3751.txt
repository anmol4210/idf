 are you Bob i am in Plano where are you oh okay i am in Waco is that right oh okay yeah laughter right down the street oh credit cards my favorite subject laughter you mean you use credit cards oh do i uh i bet you used them all up over Christmas yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off and then your are in debt and so then you have no money laughter so you use a credit card i understand that so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is do you use them a lot well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because you get Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way as long as you pay it off every month it doesnt cost you anything yeah yeah well that is a good idea that is what i that through a Visa but uh i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh if i can get away with paying them off every month it is alright if i dont then it gets laughterexpensive yeah that is my problem i dont try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know laughter so i have got myself well you shouldnt do that you you you never you you you never get out of the hole that way exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them so it is kind of strange kind of like the federal government right oh yeah exactly like the government laughter in never never get out of debt in debt for and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right yeah yeah have they put the cap on the interest rates i didnt know if they actually did that or not i know they were  i know they were considering it just the people who dont need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so uhhuh yeah vocalizednoise laughter funny how that works isnt it laughter laughter  thou thou who doesnt need credit gets cheap credit i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it well i think so because the because of the economy yeah thats right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you yeah i

hi Maureen how are you all right well do you have a family budget no we probably should but we havent so why dont you explain to me some good tips about what youve done which youve found useful and workable okay we do a few things and i have to say were my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds i im an accountant and uh he has an MBA so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that laughterso um um okay coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget  excuse me for instance i control all the household expenses the groceries the um haircuts the gasoline for my car any miscellaneous expenses babysitting things like that and uh  excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and i dont have any money uh laughter we dont buy any more laughtermilk laughterfor laughterinstance but uh weve gotten pretty good at it weve been doing it for a couple of years now so we our budgets are realistic and they are not so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable uh and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sams and things like that but uh we live we live on a on a cash budget and it it sometimes its tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it what do you do for the surprise things that you dont necessarily plan for the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that youre not prepared for well uh most of our medical things we dont uh have to worry about because of insurance and theyre theyre relatively small uh weve been lucky in the past we didnt have that problem but right now we dont for the other things the things that do crop up that we arent really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not  so i mean and im i vocalizednoise i cant really remember what it is now do you kind of continue call this like vocalizednoise a part of savings account or a different savings account um its all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know lets say its a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund you know laughter ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever uh and we just we constantly do that so that theres a build up of money for those things and if something does come up like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day and oh okay so but we have the money set aside so if it does its not going to kill us uh so were were actually were pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through then some like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses kind of thing well in our or like what what percent do you then save or something uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent of our um of our pay hm okay it and it goes toward different things its for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so laughter were starting our kids a little bit laughterearly do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things checking account a lot  uh not so much credit cards now several years back i used to use charge uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well its on sale you know it must be a good deal and there have been times that i have been bad about the credit cards and so pretty much now uh we dont use them too much if we travel or something yeah but you know standard we usually dont or if it it is a purchase uh then its paid off when the bill comes you know so it isnt any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the uh store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so its not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all right thats good and but that hasnt always been the case laughter so im kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh you know in the past and i dont have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer oh and its not deductible anymore laughter laughter yeah well ive never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow but uh or you can deduct it anyway yeah but pretty much when i always i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didnt have enough money when things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget vocalizednoise well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have i dont even remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month lets say and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and some months it may be different its not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you dont really have much control over the cash budget just fits right in there and laughter like i said if we dont have we we also set aside money for entertainment i mean its but again its a set amount every month and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we we dont we we you know we still have fun on laughterthings okay uh were in the process of trying to buy a house do you know how did your budget work or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didnt have to put down anything so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house oh okay so we we got out of that one pretty easily laughter uh yeah i i just keep thinking all the time i mean it its really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then its awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime sure i know thats how i feel about sometimes about my kids education i mean jeez they are one and four laughter we have got a long time to save up my husband hes the real hes the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually oh no no laughter well i know but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make X amount of money and where is it i mean you look around and you go where is it you you you havent made uh big purchases and thats the easier thing to see if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the TV or something like that what do you do with it i know uhhuh right but all those you know just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and theres big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff that you dont have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things thats gone used and gone oh yeah yeah its its amazing how much we spend on some things my husband cut him self down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work and thats all he has he has a ten dollar bill and i mean so id say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch the other times hell uh i dont know go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever uhhuh uhhuh but but he keeps himself on that i mean he found i mean its so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch thats a hundred dollars a month thats thats twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch laughter when he can take a sandwich you laughterknow

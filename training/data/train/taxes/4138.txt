 think about uh taxes well i think theyre a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh you spend what you have and you you dont spend more than you than you bring in yeah i think that the general idea is to spend you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but theyre running under the assumption you know the way theyre running it now theyre have you know running it under a deficit spending you know while were not under a recession so theres never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that were running so thats kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt youre not going to payoff what you owe so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay for you know get what you pay for well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living yeah vocalizednoise theres laughterso i think for for for many years uh weve paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh we have not paid them really what theyre worth in what they contribute to society i agree with that but uh then again uh its the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments i guess im a im a student right now and i dont make a whole lot of money and so i i kind of dont pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored i go to a state sponsored school and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess im kind of in debt i i suppose because i dont you know been paying taxes all that all that long my parents i guess however however however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back i will this year anyway from uh youre very fortunate laughter we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount uh laughteryeah laughteri laughteram i need it too otherwise things we dont regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money  and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay more taxes you pay it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount uhhuh isnt uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the nineteen ninety ninety one whatever nineteen ninety one uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though theres uh taxes on different things but you know theres federal theres a lot of taxes you pay that youre not even aware of that youre paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax well isnt uhhuh theres a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank the taxes that people dont think about that yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes there was that which candidates was it Jerry Brown one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a flat i think a flat percentage something like that if you implemented implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say heres my break point im not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs exactly thats because up until like eight and so based on that who do you think youre talking to youre talking to an employer up until like eighty five or something was

so what are the benefits working for a large organization gosh i wouldnt know ive never worked for a large organization that will make it interesting well i will take that back i i was in the Air Force for thirteen years i guess that qualifies as a large organization yeah i i would qualify the U S government as large if not too large sort of large yeah just a little bit little bit bigger than TI yeah yeah okay oh some of the benefits i see i i never really counted that as an organization because its uh the benefits are funny yeah the benefits are strange they change every day and uh you dont really have a lot of choice laughter not like TI do you want this or do you want this or do you want this vocalizednoise well we dont have that kind of choice either oh i mean you certain yeah out here in the real world its a lot its all the same oh really no matter who your employer is no i mean you have the choice of taking this health insurance or some other or something like that here in the Springs we have a choice of two either an HMO or a company health insurance so there are two of course i cant say we didnt have a choice if you always wanted to you could uh go out and buy your health insurance and out of your own jeans yes yeah out of your own jeans and stay a way from the base hospital which is generally what i did kind of scary it was that bad huh uh i i never fully trusted them the only time i ever went there was when i had to for a flight physical or something uh which has to be their doctor but theyre not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that well there are other benefits with the military well i dont that the civilians dont get yeah i dont i dont i dont bad mouth the military too much i had a i had a good time well i just meant from a benefit standpoint well from benefit well thats one of the reasons i made a decision to get out uh i what i perceived as the benefits were just eroding well the their pension plan is really good yeah you know that that part is good except for the except for the little thing that youre paying into social security for twenty years and when you start and then you cant draw it thats right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar and i always thought that that that was a big rip off yeah well on the other side of the fence but still but still  the way it works is that uh some employers although they have a qualified pension plan they dont have a viable pension plan and we wont mention any names dont worry theyre recording every word laughter i know i didnt say it was them oh okay youre youre right youre right but i didnt but but i didnt say it wasnt either thats right we will let them draw their own conclusions thats right draw your own inference but but but what you are saying about the military times is is true i mean fifty percent uh of your base pay is pretty good medical for the rest of your life yeah that you know that sounds great on paper but its not it i uh its not something that i would look would look forward to well we have we have had some medical retire i mean some military retirees work up here for us or a bunch really and they did use the heck out of the medical military medical now the military dental was poor no now at best but the medical seemed somewhat adequate yeah i mean dont get me wrong uh its vocalizednoise for something something that was major i i wouldnt have any problems with them its the daily uh go in with the with the flu or something like that and and the the treatment is terrible i mean first you wait for hours and hours and hours and then the guy says you have a temperature you know well i knew that were going to give you Sudafed you know ive been taking Sudafed for two weeks it doesnt do any good thats all i can do thats all i can do yeah yeah yeah  umhum yeah uh im a member of an HMO and uh from all indications its quite similar to the military yeah yeah well that thats HMOs are designed that way i mean they are going to theyre gonna theyre gonna get the most bang for their buck yeah exactly and and uh you know theyre theyre in the big profit making business the single benefits that i consider among the most important are medical insurance yeah absolutely because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life thats it forever and ever all all you have to do is you dont have it let something bad happen and that hospital will slap a lien on you so fast because they because they do it routinely yeah and yes and the funny thing is that uh private medical insurance is grossly expensive yeah oh i know i know if you are not a member of a group i know my roomies got um the insurance through the school and it it runs fifty eight i think fifty eight bucks a month something like that an thats not bad but you dont get anything thats not bad i mean to tell you well you get what you pay for dont you thats exactly right i mean its its nothing it doesnt cover doctors or anything else its crazy doesnt cover doctors no i mean you can go vocalizednoise it will cover something major but forget about things like uh eyes or your teeth or anything else it it what it is its medical insurance on paper are you covered yes are you covered really no thats right read between the lines are you covered no but you know i mean the whole health care thing in the states is so screwed up that uh yes it uh its its totally ridiculous it its a shame its it is i mean im one of those forty million Americans running around with no health insurance at the moment in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do you have to pay for those that dont have medical insurance i think its two or four dollars a person i dont remember something along those lines but it still the idea irks me so that well its sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create to tax you with or to tax you on theres a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete and assuming youre youre youre at poverty line where youre uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars tacked on to your taxable income yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make oh no but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air i wrote i i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didnt know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you or they did until last year in times past if you got a federal tax you paid state income tax on it the next year on the refund yeah uh Alabama did that too and i always thought well this is pretty nifty you taxed me when i made the money the feds and now youre taxing me again on it yeah the feds took it out and now theyre giving it back to me and now youre going to tax it again i seem i seem to recall recall something about revolutions and wars about double and triple taxation and stuff course uh course it its the by word now i mean let lets tax everything three or four times and there are tax revolutions going on currently yeah there should be but the problem is its not an armed insurrection its not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington no because because quite honestly the American people are so apathetic about everything Washington can do what they want to do and they are trying to take away our guns yeah that too im a lifelong member of the NRA im not as militant as i was when i was younger but i still firmly believe in the rights to to own and bear arms and those people that say that all that amendment to the Constitution was guaranteeing is that we will have a militia yeah thats garbage  i think they are  sorely mistaken theyre theyre wrong the militia in those days was the common man there was no organization of militia the militia made up the the everyday common man and he pulled his squirrel rifle off his wall as he walked out in the yard thats right and and if they said hey we need a militia then all the able bodied men were were supposed to show up

im not sure i even know where to begin on this mess oh it it is a mess laughter i do believe though a lot of speculative speculative buying and investment on speculation uh too many large deals with too much risk uh oh definitely umhum bad deals with friends laughter and and associates of friends and on it goes over a long period of time and i think yes uhhuh it i think its a a type of situation where okay the first investment didnt work but if we throw a little bit more money in on it maybe this one may you know and try to get our money back throw good money after bad you mean exactly exactly those you said its just not doesnt work laughter thats that is that is some of what some of what i had read is thats part of cause of it now as to the question of what to do about it oh heavens laughter i would uh it has to be government regulation oh yeah it but you know it its its i dont know laughter its not something i know a whole lot about but uh its such its such a big huge complicated mess laughter i dont either but the other thing this Dickson that they convicted he only got five years i know i couldnt believe it so thats going to leave a message to other people that yeah he can be out in twenty months they said well yes but hes in very poor health so you know twenty months may mean a lot longer for him but still yeah but yeah but still i i health and health and everything i mean if yeah its our money its our taxes that have to pay for this mess oh that well there are too i think theres too many savings and loans period theres you know you you drive down the street and theres one on every corner this is true this is very true and and it it i think its too easy to to uh form one that you know because i mean look look in Dallas theyre everywhere they were everywhere and then then they started being taken over by bigger bigger ones and then they just the bigger ones took on the little ones debt and then it it just snowballed and thats probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now yeah its it it theres just it just seemed like everybody and their brother had a savings and loan laughter this is a very true thing i didnt think about that part of it you know because you know i have never im uh were originally from Missouri and there are you know mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings and loans in the area i mean i have never seen so many as there are down here oh really thats interesting theyre theyre theyre just everywhere and and you know set up in trailers laughter i seen one on Preston Road that was set up in a trailer for a while before they built the little building oh yes yes this is true oh how funny and then uh and then uh it went out uh i mean i just wonder how much that cost us yeah and how many people lost money on that lost money in that thing but who but uh who knows its that is scary i didnt think about that well they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and millions a lot a lot better than they are have been Dickson is the only one i even heard of i mean there may be more that they are prosecuting but Dickson is the only one i even heard of they must be getting some on the national level i think ive read various things but i just no names come to mind because if he only stole six stole six hundred thousand dollars thats just a drop in the bucket compared to some of them that were were skimming millions yeah because thats a drop in the bucket to the taxes were going to have to pay to to make up for this yeah yeah because there are bigger fish i know i mean otherwise it wouldnt be in such a mess that the the stealing because uh stealing and leaving the country probably they cant they probably cant find them laughterwhat laughterthe laughterdeal laughteris laughter oh you know youve got a good point there but uh eventually you know the the tax money is getting extremely low on the FSLIC i mean theyre in theyre getting theyre getting so low it its almost in trouble and and wheres wheres that going to come from and the and the other thing is they said the insurance the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance oh yeah oh yeah laughter thats and thats frightening that is frightening because as another uh my car insurance is frightening right now i cannot believe how much money i pay oh oh our car insurance i cant either for for uh for nothing for almost nothing well and i just carry the absolute minimum required by law and im paying i mean every quarter im paying like five hundred dollars a year and that oh well you dont pay we we keep full coverage down here on everything because well its not its not that bad but thats getting off the subject laughter uh oh my but uh but the you think that they that they could come up with a better system of regulating these these little bitty uh savings and loans that uh well i you know the problem is who is they and you get they is the government the government yeah thats what i meant Congress but you get you get into when you start getting them to do things you get into a lot of special interest groups again yes exactly exactly and lobbying oh you know theres a big and you know and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people yeah thats true thats true thats what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person thats changing it they may put another loophole in that makes it even worse wasnt even there to begin with yeah and and and people like us never hear about about whats really going on and what they what theyre really doing and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because theyre there to sell newspapers thats the problem with the news both the on television and the paper television is worse television is worse well all theyre there to sell you know or to entertain even worse and uh not to transmit information uhhuh yeah thats yeah oh exactly what makes so what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to decide anything yeah yeah vocalizednoise we got these people up in Washington deciding all this stuff for us and we dont even know what theyre deciding so it its and whose best interests they represent us or someone else and how many of them were invested in just laughterhow laughtermany laughterof laughterthem laughterhave laughterinvested laughterin laughtera laughtersavings laughterand laughterloan in in a savings and loan laughter or own a or has a brother that owns yeah yeah oh yeah vocalizednoise its really a scary scary thing yeah but im its one of those one of those things that i just dont know where the answer lies its just its just its going to uh it it doesnt seem like its going as badly as it did in the past few years its kind of slow because the closings has kind of slowed a little bit well now there was an article in the paper this morning in the business section how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore oh really yeah when when you know when youre trying to buy a house how incredibly hard it is to get get a loan approved simply because theyre they are tightening down so much huh well i can see why i can see why i can see why because they were loan they were loaning money to everybody and anybody that i mean they didnt check up on people they were loaning people ungodly amounts of money that were that that that couldnt pay for it and you wonder how in the world these people got their loans why look at look at the i thirty condos i know somebody at TI that bought one of them things uh back when they first laughter opened uhhuh oh yes you know that big scam and they just they just left town they just they just packed up and left town smart move and i mean i mean they left well yes but no because they uh they left their loan hanging yes they they just oh did they thats not and that happened that happened a lot in this area people just packing up and leaving their houses and leaving the the banks and the savings and loans out to dry on the loans on the car on house loans but they are hurting their own credit that way hey i know people that it does they dont care it wouldnt i am extremely touchy vocalizednoise vocalizednoise picky about my credit rating but i know people that just dont care what they done bankruptcy means nothing to these people and it hurts all of us it when they declare bankruptcy its you and me that that have to pay for it and these people dont care oh absolutely yeah because they can you know they write all that and people that write things off as bad debt that lowers their threshold of income of what they have to pay taxes on which automatically automatically makes our taxes go up because there is so much that has to be paid oh yeah oh of course and if this guy is exempt from paying it we have to pay more thats exactly right so its just we got to take up slack and so its its its a lot of people just run running out on loans that they couldnt pay for in this area i mean you just cant imagine how many houses people just run have run out on yeah that is really sad i i know it i know it i dont think its its as bad now as it was a couple of years ago when everything just kind of fell apart you know everything just kind of fizzled what because when we moved down here in eighty three i mean there was buildings going up on every corner every week and laughter and and the unoccupied

 uh what is what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money well i  we talk about it but im usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh oh i see thats how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it um yes yeah laughter i dont mind the spending its just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so well i dont work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than whats coming in i have to go back to work so i i laughtermanage i see well im im at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh no do you actually follow a budget  well we  pretty well do um  several years we didnt and we found that we just werent making the most of of what we had and so we we um  set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then whats left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although were not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs well thats pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown and so i really dont have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to laughteryou laughterknow get things together for them and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently uh i dont always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and id put things on there that i think im not laughtergonna laughtergive laughterto and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point were in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to so im still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how were going to pay for it ahead and we do not buy used ah new cars uh do you get into the car  well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now its just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car um do you think that its wiser to buy used we do for us very much so in fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just dont go to a new car you know whatever and i said look you guys are all into car payments we havent had car payments for so many years i love it this way and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldnt it be great if we could find another one just like it believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is its the same color oh no oh wow and so everybodys saying youre kidding you have two cars the laughtersame and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again laughter thats right laughter i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and its an eighty five and so i said hey this was a cinch weve paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years vocalizednoise or next year probably do you um buy from dealers or from individuals generally from dealers and uh it depends because i dont like to sell what were trading in to an individual uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying dont bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away youre gonna get one shot at us we will laughteryou laughterknow and they say well youre kidding you know i no this is the price were going to give you out the door we dont wanna hear about taxes

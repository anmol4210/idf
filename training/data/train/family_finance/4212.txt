well Jim sounds like youre starting out on something new uh what kind of uh aspect do you have as for as budgeting well were were actually saving you know both for the wedding and for a house right now so its kind of a double whammy uh where i i stood out uh i been few i uh bachelor for a long time so you know i was kind of living for the the day and vocalizednoise what a debt so the last year or so ive been killing off a lot of debt and actually and uh in May when the stock plan im in comes due im going to wipe out the last of my debt im going to be totally out of debt in we have a nice uh start toward a house um and we we come from a very different background where i came from a fairly affluent middle class family and my fiance came from a lower class uh save every penny youve got laughterfamily so weve kind of i taught her to to let go a little bit more and she taught me to do budgeting and you know really evaluate what kind of stuff were doing well thats good  i guess our situation uh well weve been married twenty years and i guess our budgeting is its actually minimum and weve gone through period where weve needed to budget on quite formally but uh weve gotten to where we structure a lot of our thing so that they uh use use a automatic debit with our banking account  yeah i i use to do that but um i found that it it doesnt give you the flexibility floating something a couple of days when you need to right yeah i guess um you know the situation im in um my pay is vocalizednoise given at a particular period of time and it never varies and you know so theres something that weve just found that it works best to deal with the you know the the regular fixed expenses uh yeah i i suppose when when youve got you you know a a when you got a good pad of of money where you know you dont have have when youre not you know you cash flow bound thats where to work at yeah um  i guess um there really havent been a lot of thing that we have picked on that have work for us other then you know vocalizednoise the uh the automatic debits require require more discipline um it also simplifies in that vocalizednoise doesnt require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then make the appropriate trip to the bank or whoever and uh so actually we live in uh in vocalizednoise in Canada and so with our banking system being more national uh it does make uh funds transfer and that kind of thing a lot more yeah ive ive got ive got direct direct deposit i find what i helps a often lot is i have Quicken readily available on my PC and ive got for the next six to eight month all my pay checks all my fix expenses in there so i i can look at my cash flow and i can say you know ive got to pay these on these dates and i can structure these debt payment around here you know not debt payment in sense in the sense you know paying off against you know legal thing like you know paying credit cards off and things so that you know i can really map out and say on this date ill have this cash flow and ill have this net worth and that help an often lot to look forward oh i would think you know i would think it did  yeah i guess you know in the late of budgeting its something that we always have been very week on and i guess for us the challenge is now that weve got a son fifteen and a daughter eighteen that were trying to train  laughter  right well i mean i mean i found it was vocalizednoise for a long time you know i really was living for the moment and i i think that my vocalizednoise i got such mixed message message from my folks about budgeting because vocalizednoise i mean even to this day they their you know both of them are out of work now because of the one full economy in Massachusetts theyre both in social in uh you know uh human services they got hit real good but you know theyre still remodeling stuff and things so you know in in the sense you know they they would criticize me for going out and and and spending money on on things to make myself happy but then they go and you know do do what to me are cosmetic improvement to the house to you know get the same kind of thing now that that more of a value laughteradded to there house then me going out and getting CDs or something but you know its the same kind of thing where they always thought i was getting mixed mixed message about that yeah and thats  that becomes the biggest challenge you know if i think about it myself is the budgeting impact from a parenting role uh it take it takes so long for a person to develop that budgeting skill and theres  i think its going to become more critical because were now

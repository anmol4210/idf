uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them uh pretty good actually i work for Hewlett Packard and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package in fact theyre theyre kind of known uh for having good benefits the pay isnt fabulous although i saw a survey recently and im actually making just about as much as you know im making making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me so oh thats good what kind of a degree have you got ive got a Bachelors in electrical engineering so and im not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good weve got stock purchase program and a that thats pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain but uh  theres a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income uh theres how long have you been with them ive been with them for seven years uh thats good yeah and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years its pretty soon youre completely vested in the retirement plan and everything so uh its not too but theres full uh there theres several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything i dont get sick that often so i dont pay much of it but you know i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever they dont cover eyes though and i i have contact lenses so thats kind of a pain but you know i i can live but for for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered oh yeah yeah so that youve got got small small things to gripe about wow well that sounds like you must feel really good about it yeah yeah and and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing because uh i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but thats not the case so i laughter guess nothing its fabulous uhhuh uhhuh uh the what about you well i uh work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory i also have a part time job at a law firm and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does uh and benefits through the government are uh really uh  they just uh theyre not the greatest uh i before i i uh  uh got my degree im uh computer a computer scientist and before i got my degree i had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington and uh at that time i was in gravy city uh the law firms laughter in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties and uh benefits were just amazing and we had everything paid for and uh anyway with the government its not uh quite that nice a deal uh but its you know its its okay what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs and its deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet and uh  so i i think im actually involved in a relatively good plan plan at this point um but uh it could be better thats for sure and uh  but you know there there are other things that you get when you work for the government i uh in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere its really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i dont have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and  so im im really kind of happy about that end of of things its uh yeah the one of the things with my company is that theyve uh got a reputation for a lot of job security and uh theres a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do so theres uh i myself have moved around quite a bit within the company and its and i and i havent had to move my residence to do that you know i still live in San Jose and wow thats fabulous you see now thats thats interesting because i have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area he he lives in Andover yeah it oh yeah and uh the work that he hes uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the Hewlett Packard machines that do uh  uh sonographic imagining and uh ive been over to see his complex over there and its amazing its its all ecologically designed and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up yeah yeah in fact i know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who i used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position kind of interesting um uh anyhow

the basic question is too much i dont know my my opinion i guess here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the uh tax day thats when you everything youve earned so far has gone to taxes the rest of the year is yours that represents about a third of your income and i dont know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third but uh i i dont know i find myself in a position sort of like selective approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh dont agree with some of them i think that we could have less tax by cutting out some of the the uh programs that we support but overall i guess were pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel well i ive lived overseas you know its with in the Army and i see what kind of taxes they pay in other countries yeah ive done some business overseas in in Latin America and of course know about the we hear about Sweden with their uh social program but you dont hear what the cost is same in Europe in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates but the it just seems as if from the time ive been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control oh yes and then they scream about that that or the uh politicians scream about theyre going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year oh yes that thats the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or uh equating it to a personal income situation and yet its almost automatic or its hidden and uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do the one of the other problems that i have recently is centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf and i realize that constant communication is necessary especially when Bush had his uh heart rhythm problem this weekend but we can always send jets for someone i think if if theyre out of pocket rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip so thats what i meant about the selectives some things i think were doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money but other things uh like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think its one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see kids of uh any background roaming through and seeing such great collections then when when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away that bothers me a lot i dont know how to solve the problem though when as you said the uh bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for the bureaucracy continues too i i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where theyve had natural disasters and going in and giving relief aid that way but paying for their these countries to run their own governments oh i think its way i ive got a big hangup with that its way out of hand im almost turning into an isolationist laughter which is not not a good attitude in in global uh communications and everything that we have this these days but its a matter of uh i hate to see money thrown away and thats what i really i equate to some of our foreign aid policies it just seems like they keep saying were helping this country or were helping that country out and they wouldnt our money be better spent helping here at at home i agree i think thats i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare thats something i would and that subject in itself id love to see that entire thing revised oh yeah yeah i i think when you get to a point where its more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job youve got a basic concept problem somethings got to change you know and turn drastically but i i think uh if were going to waste money id almost see rather see us waste it at home laughter than overseas too and that theres some unusual things which can occur in the foreign aid uh by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and thats a lot of power vested in one one person in our system of uh and ive seen that happen over the last few years and you and i are paying for it but Jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially youve been overseas and have seen other places and i guess were still fortunate but i think were just i just want us to be smarter than we are well weve got its not like this country doesnt have the people with the knowledge weve got it weve got people that are willing to make change but as long as youve got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington playing power broker theyre not going to do anything to tap tap out the well yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term no lets see i forget was it one term or two term uh incumbency in other words they cant be reelected reelected after i think maybe the second term now thats something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too two terms then they got to sit out one yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else creating the incumbent uh invincibility invincibility theres another problem with that id weve got some good ones and i hate to see them leave laughter but it i guess its hard to to really uh identify which are the good and which are the bad the electorate seems to be putting them all back in and i thought this last election would be different but it it turned out it really wasnt and i think the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesnt matter if theyre in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine theyre going to be able to do things behind the scenes either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted thats not going to slow them down at all uh it doesnt solve the non elected bureaucrats bureaucrats either thats thats an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit in the same position and really dont give a hoot who gets elected they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the the uh horrendous regulations and everything else but its uh its our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt weve got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning uhhuh uhhuh i think thats right well the question is who whos ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt yeah How do you feel about the information we get uh from Congress that that affects us as far as the uh knowledge to to elect the right people i have i have a real problem federal register for instance uh you can have almost put anything in there you want to no its not in the federal register whats the uh the congressional record uh someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or uh trying to get the um politicians to actually truthfully report what they did vote for what they didnt vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk is almost is going to be impossible to do yeah it there is no accountability of them at any given time if youve been to Washington

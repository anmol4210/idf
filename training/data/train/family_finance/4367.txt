 okay  now well lets see i see im gonna im gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this im not real i dont have a budget laughter uh what i basically am a do is i i have a a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with laughter and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments so im real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how im going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want laughter or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and thats it right okay well thats good position to be in i guess if you dont have to worry about budgeting that whats left over goes to investments so you dont you dont then actually plan that this month im gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be well the one thing ive always done is ive put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess thats sort of a budget then at least partial right and right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh i knew i could i would be able to do that and that uh you you have to be uh responsible for your own uh  retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i said i i know that i will always be able to afford this and i said that well you know if i if i start making a significant more amount of money i i would put more into it umhum sure sure and make a new budget but ive uh its cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better laughter so ive actually probably making less money than i was when i started laughter umhum okay so although i have not changed i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less right right sure well i think laughterthats laughtertrue laughterof laughterall laughterof laughterus the um well my wife and i both work and we do plan uh we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we dont spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one so i wouldnt just go out and buy a well that  you know a i dont know a new computer laughter uh without laughter well certainly certainly your in a family situation you youd expect a little bit more uh uh you more structured and well thats true thats true uh certainly when youre single you dont have to worry about consulting with someone else and uh that type of thing  right i just kind of consult  with uh uh me myself and i you know laughter uhhuh sure sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay right laughter thats right  uh yeah i see so that makes that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier um and ive always been fairly conscientious ive never really i i dont buy anything really on a whim i do buy things that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state so youre careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy right you know i i i dont just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it sure sure and then i buy it okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if were going to get something you know whatever it may be and were comfortable and have most the things we need or want the but i do wed you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new VCR or something even once we had planned that thats what we were going to get we wouldnt just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if wed planned to get the thing right my ive always laughter you know thats what what  an accusation that an awful lot of people make towards our

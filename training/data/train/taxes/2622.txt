so uh what do you think laughter i think were overtaxed to the hilt  yeah i mean were were taxed on taxes and um uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who dont have it that is i mean we dont have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through oh really so they have no i didnt realize they had no state tax in Texas no no state income tax oh thats great because they dont have it in Florida in New York they have it i mean you know like i say im in New York and we have a state tax as well so that just cuts even more yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits right i i think that i i mean i wouldnt be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it werent for the fact that they dont they dont go to any place you know you you dont see it going to any place where it belongs i think if it were to be uh if it were to be um if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door if if it were to be spent in the right way i think i wouldnt be so upset about it but given that it that its not spent properly i think its a major problem well were really overburdened from federal state and local that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that theres not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck well thats certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something i think that so they want to you know try and i think theyre trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this they just dont theyre just not very good at doing what theyre supposed to be doing well theyre kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue thats fairness and all is for us to limit their terms and by doing so theyre not obligated to anybody i agree i agree and uh uh i dont know how were going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is its just taking uh  a bite out of our savings right exactly and then and then uh uh im im just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean itd be itd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older you know but im not convinced thats a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who dont need it but i mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it but instead i think its going to the wrong places and i believe the Social Security tax is a great pondsy scheme you think so yeah its uh you know right now theyre robbing from it to pad the federal deficit i know and that scares the hell out of me and i bet thats illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that within their private company theyd be in jail laughter so how are we letting them get away with it yeah i dont i dont well because because theyre the ones who make the laws laughter so whos going to yell at them you know itd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess right laughter to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i dont know if we can do that or not a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless oppose a lot of the situations going on in the taxing system i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if its certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if itll ever be a change process i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong you know all those things that really could be changed that arent you know that that that arent and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list so i dont know i i i have no idea what to do about it well theres no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer its just going to take uh uh really uh uh uh a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer the way its spent see we were we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place thats right we dont i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another right and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do ive never quite understood that ive never uh you know even though um um i ive never been uh sort of politically minded but its never been clear to me as to sort of you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency does doesnt back them up on anything you know and often times that will happen well they feel invulnerable invulnerable to uh any wrath or uh its its occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and dont think about it when the election time arises and generally it does work out that way they do forget its true could because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician whenever the the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this so it becomes uh a general battle of the who um the uh sort of election of the lesser of two evils i think so i dont know i just uh im unhappy with it but and well im im sort of semi fortunate right now im a graduate student so i dont make that much and what i make isnt taxed very highly because im still in school well when you get out into the real world then you will know my my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck im just floored when i see how little of it were actually allowed to keep especially around bonus time bonus time you have a bonus bonus she no my my wife does oh laughter my wife i dont no graduate students dont get bonuses were lucky to get paychecks the way i figure so youre taxed on the bonuses too right my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and thats a thats usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isnt that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something so she gets destroyed on her bonus check so she works with in in in sales so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses uh sales is lucrative but then youre paying really high taxes when youre doing a lucrative job yes well yeah shes not entirely sales so it isnt it isnt as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more so i dont know i dont i guess i guess at this point in time were just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better well i have i guess about said what all all i can think of to say same here tough topic so yeah its really a rather touchy topic at that but laughter i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly its been a pleasure talking with you well thats great you too and uh have a good day thanks for calling you too byebye

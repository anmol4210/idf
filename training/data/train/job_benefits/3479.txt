well what do you uh  how do you feel about your uh job benefits well im a contract person and uh so i dont have a lot of benefits and uh uh i do think theyre very important my husband has medical insurance and he has a life insurance policy his company does not really have a retirement plan and i think thats something thats very important and uh i believe medical insurance and retirement are probably the two strongest yeah well i um  i worked for a  two most important a large oil company for ten years and then resigned in eighty four and went into business for myself uh and what i discovered at one after i had resigned it was kind of amazing i had never really thought about that corporate umbrella yes laughter right while while it was there and after i resigned and i walked out from under it i really felt exposed and it was something that i had been completely you know you grow accustomed to having that behind you or or or over you yeah you sort of take it for granted absolutely and it was ill ill tell you i was absolutely amazed at how at at the difference and then laughter plus whenever i had to start paying for my own health insurance oh i know isnt that a shock and and life insurance  believe me it was it was a rude awakening  so anyway i was in business for myself for six years and then i have gone back to work uh since uh nineteen ninety im back in Houston with another oil company so im back under that corporate umbrella and i will tell you i am glad to have the laughtercoverage laughteragain  laughter well we uh kind of discovered it when uh the company my husband was with uh was in real estate and he had some nice benefits with it and all of a sudden when the market dropped out up here of course then you know everything kind of went downhill and then he went with a steel company and they they folded but he was still under the uh COBRA plan on the medical insurance and then all of a sudden the people that had taken it over went bankrupt well that ended COBRA plan plan and everything and uh then we discovered vocalizednoise and our medical insurance for three months was running us uh i think it was nineteen hundred dollars you know our age and uh i had some arthritis and stuff and man they socked it to us uhhuh  and you know course now fortunately we were back we have some medical insurance well i feel like im im the luckiest person in the world on in several ways number one i had the opportunity to get out whenever i left um   uh Houston in uh eighty four and resigned i had the opportunity to get out and do all those things that i thought would be so glamorous and exciting wording working for myself laughter yeah laughter and they were and they were for a while and then i found out that it was just as much work to do that as it is going into an office you know getting on a plane and flying around and all that kind of stuff  umhum umhum umhum what did you do consulting work well no actually i was uh my brother and i had a architectural design firm we did uh retail tenant finish out all over the US and it was oh uhhuh you know very successful and a lot of fun and more work than ive ever done in my life and at the same time i got all of that out of my system and it is so its so wonderful now and im so appreciative too of and and i know now i think so much better than some of my coworkers what it means to and have somebody thats providing laughter umhum laughter some of this stuff for you and uh you know im real lucky my company has good uh health benefits and dental benefits umhum and also uh retirement plan on a contributory thrift plan that im i was just thinking about that today i need to up my contribution to that if i can force myself to save a little bit more umhum well i know that my husband the company hes with now has excellent uh hospitalization and prescription card and dental insurance but they have no retirement uhhuh yeah benefits and you know we definitely you know miss this i grew up in a family that had their own business you cannot pay me enough money to go into business for myself and my laughterhusband has watched my family and i dont believe you could pay him enough yeah well i tell you until youve done it you dont know what its like you you its on your mind twenty four hours a day seven days a week and im i literally drove myself nearly insane i was at the office on Saturdays and Sundays id get up at umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum youre always id get up at id be sitting around at at nine nine oclock at night and get up and go to the office and work until one oclock you you know and well and you think you know okay laughter you know are the employees going to get paid this laughterweek you know are we going to meet our vocalizednoise i precisely precisely and then the employees get paid and you dont laughter thats right thats right i can remember my dad saying somebody saying they wished you know beef wasnt so high you know they could only afford chicken and my dad said if someone doesnt buy some beef im not gonna be able to afford the chicken yeah yeah you know and uh well ill tell you ill tell you the odds are definitely stacked against the small business person they they really are they really are cold um uh the problem that we ran into is that you know we we  got beyond just being a real time

hi do do you have lots of credit laughtercards laughter yeah we well we have quite a few but we dont really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when were traveling and stuff wherever theres a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa we dont use those too often what about you um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them but i think ive even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasnt using them too much and i dont drive that much but i have you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen laughtermillion cards but as long as like my MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i dont know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here dont let you do it too much oh really and so i dont but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but its not really a credit card oh is it like an automatic debit or something oh huh its a it its a debit card yeah and um just you know its vocalizednoise many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash baside bye thanks easide um yeah because theyre just so well set up with it laughter yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money set aside already to and then we just pay it off the next month we never pay we dont like to pay interest on the laughtercredit cards at all right well yeah i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i laughteroccasionally do and you know ill forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didnt get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit uh finance charge on it which pissed me off because um you know i really did mail it in time right yeah they have no proof of that i dont i dont want to ill probably talk to them some more discuss it but i i never um usually never laughterpay finance charges laughter yeah that yeah we we screwed up one laughtertime laughterlike that too we mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check i had that hassle one time and i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it so you know i guess i dont know who the the burden of proof is on yeah i dont either you know its kind of a because you never do when i pay bills i dont make a Xerox copy of it or i dont no you figure youll get your check back if you have to right or i dont get a i dont mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank to have a proof of when i mailed it and i mean you cant do that itd be ridiculous laughter really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i dont do real often or something from out of state you know where if somethings wrong you dont want to end up having to pay for it a couple times ive had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didnt really get this or well you can i dont know what this is right or i returned it so dont charge it yeah well thats basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um didnt wasnt didnt do what these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldnt do that so he brought it back to them and theyre supposed to modify it and so i called the credit card company and said well we havent really taken possession because its not useful for us we cant use it and then they said well then dont pay it and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soon as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now theyre hitting vocalizednoise laughter with a finance charge oh laughter but its sort of you know its its half our fault yeah since it well yeah if you filed that letter with them then theyll kind of and so we right if id filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay so i learned that for the next time im like you too about the yearly fees i dont uh i dont like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we dont have to pay a yearly fee on and since we dont pay the interest it doesnt really matter what the interest rate right yeah is to us as long as we dont have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety laughterdollars or something i think i cant remember but we decided let that one go and well my husband and i both have that and i dont know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think its like seventy five dollars for me and im not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like vocalizednoise nowadays im not sure so sure that its worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express and then they dont have the credit limit because ive over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and youre over the limit on the credit card and um with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell you that but then that was one advantage but thats thats like i dont i think its seventy five dollars for me and forty for him for a year which is a lot be vocalizednoise but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one thats free because there are some like i think ATT has one thats free if you make two purchases a year its more worth it well so laughter yeah that wouldnt be too hard to do laughter yeah and so thats easy enough to do and if thats true thats um it it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that weve never had that problem either i and i dont understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i dont understand yeah because people think it doesnt really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process and sometimes it comes in right away and its like oh well i laughterguess i have to pay that too because yesterday like many times ill try ill buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i wont get that bill until the next bill not this bill and itll come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway yeah laughter but sometimes the vocalizednoise is long like ive had things that i didnt get billed on for two or three months yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have those i guess theyre called those pointed sale terminals where its like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah immediately yeah but thats what happened with us like we bought a washing laughtermachine laughterseven months ago and then i got billed like the next laughterday oh laughtergosh it didnt matter because we couldnt have paid for it by check but we prefer vocalizednoise like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that yeah thats nice you can uh return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October and you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year weve got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturers guarantee and somethings like that are yeah i like that feature and the insurance like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something thats breakable or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so thats you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage but things like if your baggage gets lost you get money for that oh really to buy new bags and things like that oh i didnt know that and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so

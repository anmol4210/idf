 excuse me laughter oh go ahead Ken so Ken how do you do your family budget well we dont actually have a budget budget per se what we do is uh sort of maintain a normal checkbook you know like everybody in the world does i guess and occasionally it actually balances and then um we also we um we have a a US Air Visa card and then every every dollar we every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage oh yeah its a real good deal actually if you charge a lot so what we what what my wife and i have taken to doing is charging everything in sight anything we buy we charge including groceries and so forth so what well do is well then you just pay it off at the end of the month right we actually maintain a we have a savings a savings we have we we we have a checking account that we treat like a savings account scratch that we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account and so what we do is we anytime we do it or make or charge something we write it out as if we wrote a check and then at the end of the month all the moneys there covered already so we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything oh thats a really good idea it keeps us hopping laughter yeah see now id never get my wife to be able to follow that before we got married i had money in the bank i owned my own home i put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know and uh after i got married no it just didnt work anymore uh she spends a lot she likes to spend on anything and everything laughter with body lotion laughter everything so we really havent uh we dont have a good organized system yet maybe after awhile ill rub off on her or something laughter i dont think laughter well you know you know whats you know whats always good is sort of a force savings where they just take money out of youre pay we did that for awhile where um we actually still do it with with my wifes salary where we put it we have a separate a a a third account even um i mean a savings account in an in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week im a graduate student uh oh really in what field yes so am i yeah uh well uh in information systems im a voice researcher oh okay im in uh i i work in psycholinguistics actually um but my wifes has a real job yeah and what shell yeah laughter so what we do is we take money out of her out of her paycheck each week yeah so does mine laughter and and put it it it goes directly into another account that we dont at at a at an entirely separate bank that we dont have access to so easily and it it goes there and it stays there and it builds up until we need it for something yeah see i think we might have to do that laughter because she looks at what she brings home each week i its going to be really hard for her to uh not have her own money because like now you know i put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years and now she wants to go back to school but she saved enough maybe to get her through August you know and thats it even and i keep saying now Laura youre going to have to save a little money i dont know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through it doesnt work Ken laughter my mother always said dont argue about money so we dont right thats the thing you you you dont argue about it uh but uh but you know uh there goes my savings laughter but you know i its one of those things its oh God oh God yeah i i got lucky my wife apparently is is is not a she likes to spend but shes pretty good about things yeah now see my wife will do things like make clothes oh wow uh you know one of our one of our big investments that you know was i was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine because she makes clothes and you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and and shes already made you know presents and gifts and things for shorts for me and things for the summer you know so i guess i cant you know weve probably almost paid off the sewing machine with uh thats great with the money savings there yeah the savings from that so i cant complain too much you know she shes good about that and also we we dine at home a lot you know she likes to cook so that saves us from restaurants or whatever but thats good but she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money money dumped down a drain you know right well i guess we all have those things though i mean i uh i uh  i i go to uh i pay what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know for the you know i pay up through the year yeah but you need a hobby right exactly so you know that but that to her is sort of a waste but but she does her nails so yeah thats true yeah laughter i know and those nails are so expensive i know laughter oh gosh i was so excited when she decided she wasnt going to do her nails anymore i guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow and then she waits for them to get their color back and then shell polish them again i dont know whatever so she stopped for awhile boy what a difference they buy nail polish every two weeks its laughter uh gosh and lotion oh my goodness body lotion oh yeah we spend more on on soft body on on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things uh she must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year and so yeah laughter good old Ivory um well it its for your benefit though right thats what laughter yeah its funny oh i think so shes always soft thats true vocalizednoise always soft vocalizednoise you know uh so so thats helpful yeah yeah yeah but i i think um i dont know maybe after uh were not in school anymore well be much better at saving i think uh i think thats uh now do you still own a house you said you owned one i sold my house and thats whats really paying for my uh time unemployed or whatever you know because the graduate assistantship really doesnt cover the ten thousand dollars in tuition really doesnt cover living expenses oh thats great uh now well we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job so that makes it hard um with you know were paying double rent and double utilities oh wow and that makes it sort of expensive but see i live within my i live within my meniarmenial menial laughter very menial income and she doesnt laughter she doesnt live within her her professional income you know so i just get a right there thatll kill you thats the killer two apartments and stuff like that yeah and and then even if we want to see each other on weekends its twenty five thirty dollars in gas every weekend and that really adds up too you know so it uh it gets tough but i well thatll kill you yeah i think well do much better when were living together and were only paying one rent and one telephone you know well itll cut our telephone bills eventually right i mean youre not you know yeah by five by four fifths you know if if if shes here so its its actually tough this year but itll be better in June shell be move live together in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then right my God have you been married for long or no just since December oh wow so you guys really are newlyweds yeah yeah were vocalizednoise very newlyweds and but thats the you know we were together for probably um oh wow uh very close for about six months before we got married so you know we lived within uh though i owned held had my own house and things you know we still uh were still pretty close and i knew her spending habits and and theyre about the same they havent changed at all you know laughter my mother always said to me Tom now the best thing to do is be like youre father never say a word when youre wife spends money and i was like well thats true my dad never said a word you know yeah so i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes because i think you know um i sort i sort of feel guilty if you laughterknow given that she makes twice as much as i do so i sort say you know if she wants to go out and buy something i never argue with her because shes vocalizednoise shes real good at you know sort of saving and um yeah i dont i dont argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face you know must be like  like must be cringes or something you know um especially like yesterday or this past weekend we met half way between at uh at her parents house and um she had on a new pair of jeans and shed gotten all new underwear and i was like  Laura laughter how did you get all this stuff she goes well i just got paid and laughterand i was like oh had the money in their pocket yeah yeah it was there it was burning it had to be spent you know but she said everything was on sale and im like oh oh thats good at least it was on sale thats good honey im glad you bought it on sale laughter what else can you say thats right i do recommend the force savings bit the uh they take it out of your paycheck before you see it because then it doesnt hurt yeah i think yeah you dont notice it i think thats probably a really good idea you know you dont even think about it if its gone you know so uh until you really need it and then all of a sudden you realize youve got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else you know we managed do it that way yeah see i i was when i had when i was living alone and i had my own house and things uh you know i put one i was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage and the food bills and it and i was even able to you know to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account because im pretty thrifty and you know but my wife likes to spend she enjoys so thats fine laughter but uh for savings ill have to look into that yeah thats just that and that uh that has been our godsend you know we had weve had some sort of major emergencies come up you know where um we also own our own house um we had an ice storm up here recently yeah yeah where it was it was pathetic i mean it was horrible i mean half the half the city owned trees or or or or half the one third of of of all the vegetation in this county is just wiped out oh really because of the heavy ice yeah it just it just weighed exactly it broke the limbs and our um we had to trim our backyard that tremendous willow tree that is it fortunately we didnt have to bring it down all the way but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it still not all of it they dont get you know and that plus and then we had a car expense like that same week one of the cars died you know all those things then they add up and that force savings really comes in handy then yeah yeah i can see that thats i keep trying to say to her you know Laura dont spend so much what happens if something happens to a car you know shes oh well itll you well nothingll happen ooh ooh i always just shut

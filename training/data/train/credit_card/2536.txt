well how do you use your credit cards i use them carefully i guess um i uh i usually dont i usually use them to consolidate billing uh for convenience sakes but i usually just pay them off at the end of the month yeah especially what i do i dont i dont avoid the finance charges uh as high as they are i dont uh ridiculously high you know i dont let them carry over you know i uh ive been lucky i guess i havent had a bill big enough where i couldnt pay them off at the end of the month but i i try to try to live within a budget you know and so well so i keep that in mind i just dont you know i guess it takes selfrestraint when you have a credit card to know that that theres really you really have to pay these things laughteroff yeah plus a lot more laughter plus a lot more you know and you got to realize that theres only this much money in the bank and if youre going to live you know yeah well if youre not going to try to you know say well ill pay it off sometime in the future yeah for so many years i was so deep in debt on credit cards and i finally dug my way out of them and that was enough to teach me you know you just laughter i can do without them right vocalizednoise some people have a rip theirs up just because they cant you know they cant resist them i got rid of a lot of them especially the ones where i paid fees uh i kept the ones that were free and basically the same thing i use them if im running short of cash and theres something i want or sale a sale or when i travel i use them i use them to float sometimes if its near the end of the month and you know and you know i dont have a check coming in a few days yeah yeah yeah its about ill go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there yeah thats what i do by the time the bill comes yeah if theres running into a cash short or something theres some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card uhhuh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times i dont like to carry a lot of cash with me vocalizednoise i have so i just carry my credit card and and for things like that as long as i know you know that im im not over doing it laughter its a and yeah i have i have what i have two credit cards thats all i use im always getting stuff in the mail all the time yeah yeah i you are a preferred such and such and you are yeah youre youre already approved then its back youre already approved to get i uh for the longest time i id gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months but uh sometimes they just send them to you and say here have a credit card laughter i have that one oh do you yeah yeah i just ripped i just cut it up and threw it away but you know vocalizednoise oh you should have used it you wouldnt have been liable for the payment is that right huh i didnt know that they yeah they send you card that that you didnt want that you didnt apply for its yours is that right of course they could always stick something in the credit bureau laughter thats right thats right they could they can make your life miserable if they want to sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago is that right uh and i i tore up their card and sent it to them and now ive got another one laughter we dont have too many Exxon stations out this way oh really what do you got out there uh weve got lots of Mobil Mobils yeah Mobils are big and we have a few Exxon weve got some other ones like Citgo yeah is a is a one yeah well i dont think i dont think weve got a Citgo here in Raleigh no matter of fact i know we dont got some Shell stations a few Texaco stations we have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas but theyre not Citgo stations i guess the biggies around here are Exxon Texaco and um well gosh thats about it BP i guess and theres another local one i cant i cant remember what theres some few Sinclair stations gosh i havent seen a Sinclair station in years yeah the few theyre the green dinosaurs are their their gosh there used to when i was a when i was a kid there was a Sinclair station about three blocks away thats where i used to go to pump up my tires and get my flats fixed and all of that vocalizednoise  logo yeah theres not that many down here that you know once once in a while youll see one i guess theyre still in business just barely i guess well just you ever you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they theyve charged charged you for something you didnt didnt no uh i ive nope ive never had that didnt purchase i i did have a problem with American Express one time about ten years ago when i first got started in a business um yeah i have they got my name of course and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them saying you havent paid youre overdue pay it so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call from someone saying say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing and i said what are you talking about ive already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check so they said okay well take care of it two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else and never heard from them uhhuh somebody blew it but i just yeah i just you know i aint got time to mess mess around with them too many people want my money out there i dont have to pay somebody to take it do you have the Discover card no i dont i i kept wanting i kept thinking about getting it but i just dont use the things enough to justify getting it either either do i they they i dont know i dont know how anybody can fall into this you get cash back and buy into that because all theyre giving you back is a little bit of the interest you paid in thats right thats thats right youre paying youre paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it yeah their interest right their interest rates twenty two percent higher than any other ones and then they said that well give you back some of your money hum thats right laughteryeah right and in the meantime for that entire year theyve got the use of that money uh like uh yeah its it its a ripoff oh it is i theres so vocalizednoise but a lot of people think its wonderful i guess said theyre theyre doing well everything ive read theyve been getting a more market share i guess theyre theyre advertising and promotions and well vocalizednoise uh Americas Americans are suckers yeah i guess so i dont know they dont know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this ones twenty two hum yeah i have a on my credit cards i have a grace period if i pay it off within when the bill comes i i dont have to owe any interest yeah i yeah right thats and uh ive only got ive only got two uh two cards now ive got a Bank of Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard and and thats it i mean i i dont need anything else now umhum  yeah once in a while uh my i have an American Express they have this vocalizednoise a buyer protection thing where you they extend the warranty so uh they both can be nice around Christmas time and stuff if youre going to buy a TV or uh or uh vocalizednoise electronic yeah something something like that my roommate really believes in American Express hes got the green card or the gold card and the the Optima card and and everything huh he just he just thinks theyre terrific and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card well if you have the money i guess laughter laughteryeah laughterim im thinking myself get what you pay for huh really yeah you know hes hes impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess its every year they itemize all your purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that uh yeah its a nice report but is it worth you know is it worth sixty bucks a year vocalizednoise for that little for that laughterreport dont be crazy uh when i was over in England i picked i picked up that uh Bank of Scotland Visa card and i i dont know hardly i dont ever use it except when i want to play the currency market um thats thats when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things for what im getting and then if if i think the rates going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars and it its worked out most of the times im im usually pretty good on calling the the currency market uhhuh yeah a lot of people do that for a living i guess trade trade money yeah i i did it  when i lived over there i did it quite often um and i really i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states and the bank that i banked with i could write them a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for

before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying id id start cashing in my checks for pounds and then by the time the other check went through it the it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and it it was great i mean i i could made a little extra money there huh yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get

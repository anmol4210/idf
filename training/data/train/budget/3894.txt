the federal budget  boy i was just writing something down that came to mind as i observed whats happened in our society we i think have become uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself i agree with that and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that we have elected people who really dont know how to manage the money uh they collect  well what weve got um in my view is  is a situation where  weve got more people like you say that are customed that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research thats now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT i mean were talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption yeah well i i really i think if you  from a vocalizednoise laughteri laughtermean uh you know i hate to admit that in a way but its true yeah i i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think were gonna have to eventually balance the budget or were gonna sink we cant continue to pay the kind of interest that were paying on the deficit right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world thats true there are lot of things we dont we dont need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we dont need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy farm i mean basically you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are its not that we dont have the resources we are just squandering them oh yeah throwing them away uh its just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they dont spend their allotment uh thats the way it was working on a defense department contract thats what happened vocalizednoise then theyre then theyre subject to losing the next years allotment right well thats the way the thats the way the thing works yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the end at year end thats right ive seen that happen and its it whats even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations  is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because were the smart guys and without us society cant function and that thats no license to steal right thats true i mean i i honest to God believe thats what whats been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts well and and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable its no longer acceptable well and well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if its if there if its federal money then its free money well its not it costs everybody and uh it you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh uh that doesnt necessarily make it morally uh responsible right and it its not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldnt survive and do a a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought theyd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and well and and and vocalizednoise well dont even began to talk about the educational system i mean is that is one example where its being proven that throwing money does not create a good education okay well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they havent been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if its that good and you really yeah but im even talking im im not even im not even talking about higher education were im talking about the the kids that weve got now they come out of high school that cant read and write and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them right but all the people laughterwho who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges uh true okay and my point is hey wait a minute somethings wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if its the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around okay so ask yourself some questions why dont we have a higher quality with one of the worlds great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education i mean this is a focus its not like this isnt an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they cant produce something like MTV which kids want

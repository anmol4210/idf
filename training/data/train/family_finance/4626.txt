 okay laughter how are you you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you laughterbudget yes yeah well i i i i feel like um i am from Mars i mean im fifty years old and uh ive been divorced for um eighteen years but ive two kids and all but i uh i ive never had a budget and i dont uh i dont do any planning and i dont know vocalizednoise i dont uh i dont have a longterm financial plan and i dont try to control my expenses but im im glad youre a stranger laughter that sounds kind of like me but really im im in a happy i i well im curious how other people live uh so maybe we should start with you laughter what do you laughterdo about the same thing  yeah oh maybe theyre going to arrest us both im even even in worse shape because i have eight children and uh we live from hand to laughtermouth we hope that theres enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if theres not then we laughtertry laughterto laughter due for the next month a couple a couple of times weve tried some things and they worked but im not disciplined enough to keep doing it the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty laughter then you didnt have any more money to spend in that area and that worked out real well cause we didnt have to keep writing down what wed spent it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money and we did that pretty successfully for about three months laughterand then we laughterstarted laughterborrowing laughterfrom laughterone laughterenvelope laughterto laughter laughterput it in the laughterother envelope and laughter in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do huh the um i had a parttime job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but i i had miscalculated i well i didnt keep a balance laughter its one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when youre only earning half the salary even though i wasnt spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning but i would forget to write the things down and it it that i i dont know if i ever went as far as three months or not laughter in in keeping that kind of data i certainly havent done that in sixteen years or whatever i even find now like with the automatic tellers ill go take money out of that and then i forget to take that out of my laughterchecking account and uh so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that whats really there and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make the uh i i i have to say that lets see at this point on i dont run out of money um and it uh and and i dont i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i dont have and i i i i think my strategy if if i may is is is is to is to not spend money i mean i dont have expensive tastes i dont go out i mean i buy a car well the last car i got rid of id had it was nineteen years old people people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and it was still running oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five Buick and it just wouldnt stop um and it i i just didnt feel the need for a new car it isnt like i couldnt afford one uh and now i mean i i dont uh i tend to eat expensive food i mean i dont mind buying a good steak but for me i only do that every week or um without even i mean maybe once a month i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so its six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids youre not going to run out and do that laughter not very often but but im just im just saying as a single person thats thats a drop in the bucket and so if youre extravagant on how you buy food it doesnt add up if youre buying mean if youre not going to super expensive restaurants which i dont care to go to thats right so so thats i think one of the reasons i dont need to budget is that i dont have i dont i dont have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i cant afford it because im not interested in that expensive thing

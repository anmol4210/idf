okay you wanna start um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back if you cant pay for it you shouldnt have it period that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans thats just uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something master charge i dont have a master charge thank you laughter but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing right but thats the problem see as our system shouldnt be based on owing and borrowing and all that uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldnt be able to own automobiles or they wouldnt be able to own a house yes they would they just wouldnt be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i were twenty eight if we lived our lives and didnt become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldnt be destitute i mean we wouldnt be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it i would be so good it would be so much better it wouldnt be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent im just taking the other side just so well have a discussion uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it i didnt need it i shouldnt have even qualified to get it i didnt need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it and as i look back now now were paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but dont take out ten thousand dollars in loans dont do it and i dont i hope dont think hell have to do that but i just so like we might if we didnt have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because Gods really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy including new vans and so so i guess ive seen it done and i know you can do it you know but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van and thats where Americans dont like to do it and so and we dont want to cut back our services from the government because were spoiled well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget very simple just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like Columbus Day Presidents Day i mean they get they get all these days off now give them i know laughter what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year i know and thats about uh three or four less than civil servants get now just look at that money the government could save if they didnt have all of those days off all those holidays yeah that is true because i always think the mail never comes on these days and youre like well what is it laughter you dont even know its a holiday laughter well now dont forget the mail is something else again that has nothing theyre not civil servant people but isnt that federal in the federal budget no no they have their own budget they go by but isnt it part of our income its not part of our taxes no you know thats why vocalizednoise the price of mailing a letter keeps going up its not thats why it keeps laughtergoing laughterup huh thats another topic you know i could i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter those stamps are valuable now yeah laughter they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail thats funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that that overall though i just think were just going to i dont know see i know i guess im kind of leery of this topic because i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to be a potential power problem later with um whos going to be in charge with this new world order and i you know im uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money system we already have new bills printed for vocalizednoise US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean ive seen them laughter and so i know that the longterm vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh but im concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know thats a lot of power for one or two people to have and so um i guess because i i guess i feel like i know what their longterm vision is im kind of like you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i dont think Americans are willing to do it well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments how do you feel about that i dont i dont feel we should loan them money if i i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i dont feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesnt work are they gonna well in so many cases its not a loan its just a give a giveaway but its not but its not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because were our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back it be do you understand its i guess its a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but because theres no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because were loaning it i think thats the problem and i dont mean give it to everybody that asks use a lot of discernment dont give money to every nation you know what im saying i think were loaning money to too many nations but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think were never going to get that back you know do you understand no that thats true i i understand that France still owes us money from World War I and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off and said well well cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them right long what long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you cant alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially thats my opinion my opinions the latter uhhuh well uh ive got to respect your opinion you have some uh solid ideas i know but whats yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term well i dont believe in a single government or a single control for the world uh thats asking for trouble people are too different i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run so therefore i dont believe there could be a single government for the whole world theres too many societies involved uh the language barriers uh oh sure they somebody said years ago well lets make it English uh an international uh language thats a big laugh we cant even make English a a national language here in our country weve got too many uh uh uh immigrants yeah um they dont call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddys day yeah different ethnic groups laughter a vocalizednoise well yes yeah but uh yeah i know what youre saying my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century and uh as a matter of fact hes a draft dodger he uh was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you

 okay ill let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours laughter no i i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible well thats thats good laughter especially for these times and uh and its its sort sort of always worked uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can laughter i guess have self control well thats a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didnt keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she wont quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what shes buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldnt think about and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that werent supposed to be every month well yeah i i couldnt probably be bothered doing doing that uhhuh  thats what i mean it was a hassle laughter every month and and every since uh well weve been married almost thirty years now but um my my husband got paid once a month so laughter you learn to get through laughter you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh laughterthats thats kind of hard laughter but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldnt like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way dont you no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isnt anything left to spend anyway well thats true what were in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely and were going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next laughtermonth well yeah we we tried to to to or we are paying them off now or there was a time when maybe we didnt pay all of them off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is yeah were not there yet thats right thats right and for most of uh i mean im a substitute teacher and ive only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so theres only been really one working  and uh  umhum same here yeah it it works for me but i cant see that it it would work for probably the majority of people well i could say its kind of you know thats thats good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have to you know what im saying and so that thats the difference there where sometimes like i know if weve had an especially bad month and were just almost getting down to payday then i think if we could really budget we tried one time i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadnt had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener umhum yeah umhum it it is when you do it that way vocalizednoise laughter uhhuh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes ill spend less on groceries but well go out so its kind of hard to say this is how much youre gonna spend going out for fun this is how much youre gonna spend its kind of hard do you well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldnt you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks yeah yeah right laughter right oh how nice ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the laughterwhat minuscule amount i made but that way you just didnt put it on your credit card and and it was paid for laughter with well thats good and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah vocalizednoise yes and so i think that thats difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um i think so too so if youre out like in a department store and theres a sale youre just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that thats excellent thats what im working toward i think youre probably much ahead of me there and im working on it and i never worried about saving money because we just were in the savings plan at work and they took it out so same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you dont have to go through the company to get laughter you know yeah i uh well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh that came up yeah and we didnt buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my were looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars and they were mainly used cars well thats the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasnt worth it from the day after so yeah so you know weve been laughterrather rather frugal in that rather frugal well that thats gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess weve completed do you think weve been here ten in that respect yeah  well each each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh

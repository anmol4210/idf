 were talking about taxes taxes right you think you think you pay too much all right well you is what they said and do you think youd get what you pay laughterfor thats hard to say you know i think it take a lot for granted you know and its the the quick answer i think would be that you pay too much taxes you know but but i think if you think about it um all the highways we have all the uh federal programs we have whether theyre good or bad um sure seems like you do get a bang you know it seems like a lot of stuffs going on even though every paycheck a lot of moneys coming out um i dont know i dont know it seems like so i used to think that government spent too much and they probably do but you know when you go to your doctor your doctors private also and uh theyre gonna charge you a good buck for whatever theyre doing also so well what do you think well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i dont think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas we could do better in a private sector i think it just ive done some reading on this and some and in some of the areas you know youre lucky to get back a a dime on a dollar on some programs uh but i also know that people to me wont do what they should do to help each other and they wouldnt have so much government if we did and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicines coming which i hate to see but i think because theres so many people without insurance thats whats coming you know its coming yeah its needed so uh but no i dont probably feel like i get back what i pay now you do you pay state income tax in yeah i i pay actually state city and federal yeah see here a lot of people think in Texas were lucky because we dont pay um state income tax but they get us in other ways you know yeah well i i just figured it out today i get uh i think my my two week pay is sixteen hundred and eleven dollars or something like that sixteen sixteen something around there and my take home after taxes is about eleven  um yeah so five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out you know and obviously if you make you know forty thousand dollars a year youre paying ten thousand in dollars a year in taxes and everybody whos in that type of income is paying that i think thats another problem you know plus sales tax right  uh yeah well thats where they got us here you know every time they need something they up the quote users fees or the sin taxes you know on beer and such sure sure and plus you pay if you buy cigarettes you pay tax on that if you buy beer yeah so just because we dont have a state income tax they get us proportionately higher in other areas yeah yeah so i dont know you dont have a state income tax in Texas thats so yeah thats not so bad but they still have to get the money somewhere to they get it somewhere and and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax you can take it off you federal so we cant take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform but thats what they up it they up it on gasoline they up it on um say beer and cigarettes uh users fee drivers license license plates it all just keeps going up and up and up and they tell us its not really taxes laughteryou laughterknow laughteryou laughterknow laughterbut it is and uh no i dont know i dont know what the answer is to all this i think uh same difference i dont know i i think its a i i dont know i i think i think its like private like you said privatization is good because you know when the profit uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people arent going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh thats the attitude that uh at least my agency takes you know they they when they take the attitude that uh this is a business and and if youre not going to run it profitably then youre going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency and and its unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing and we make more money than we than we cost so uh well thats really unusual so nobodys ever going to question my salary or anybody else on my staff uh especially my unit because my unit is a revenue producing unit uh there are other you know things that that may i mean look at that i was talking to my father the other day about the NASA program you know he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff but yet then again they come up with all these scientific discoveries that may help save us sometime i mean i think it was NASA that weve learned a lot yeah you do learn a lot so youre not you you know youre paying all this money but youre getting something back for it uh you know military spending is the same thing whether you agree or you disagree with building all these bombs and stuff which i happen to have a tendency to disagree with uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether its right

there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary boy i i i dont know thats a thats a a tough one uh uh and its uh i suppose its its changes as uh as perception my perception changes of of what uh im getting gypped on laughter this week or this month uh uh that week right uh were just uh going through uh uh well theres a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh if i step back im not sure id id uh say that what what about you well um i uh right now im into a weird situation im a graduate student and uh oh okay uh i dont have that many benefits per se laughter okay but but on the other hand vocalizednoise one of these days youll be out looking for a sort of get yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um uh i think health insurance is real real important uh ive ive ive ive discovered i mean even in my case its sort of theyre really um a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical vocalizednoise they they force you to buy here now im covered by my wifes anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester right okay for uh mandatory so thats sort of annoying that im paying for something im not getting in that case id rather that that went to something else and and yeah and the benefits youre getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wifes right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think theyre very theyre excellent physicians there so through my wifes HMO weve registered for them as our primary care physicians so we go there anyway so theyre theyre so if they were to bill which which i believe they dont but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but theyre not thank God um but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i dont know if thats really a deciding factor for many people on a job i dont you know uh yeah i it uh the that that is thats a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there its uh if i remember right you well if they they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i im coming up on ive been at TI now uh uh coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah thats a that that is a a a negative but uh oh wow  so thats the real  but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh yeah i mean i dont you know i dont i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but theyre pretty good about it if she wants other time off they vocalizednoise you know usually let her well that that yeah thats uh that thats the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh thats the the the uh yeah that thats uh why it hasnt made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour oh really and uh and but uh there wasnt uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh the the actual vacation time per year probably isnt that isnt that much different but uh thats oh thats a but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think thats thats going through changes everywhere to uh the theyve uh uh thats reasonable i think gone through a couple years ago here where they uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now theyre in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that just routine visits uh ah they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah weigh are see such of things yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that thats good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance and in other cases its actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you dont work for somebody thats got enough clout to to uh uh give you you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh youre youre not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh im not im not sure it my uh one of the phrases i use is that that its moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where its the government that decides here its its uh at least us who decides yeah uh and but it but its the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share youll youll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i i dont know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh although ive ive been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctors doing the right thing to make me get better right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that thats the yeah and

 vocalizednoise i pressed i pressed one all right uh on uh all right benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh theres a little more in backup when i need it do you work outside of the home yes i do i work for the school system Richardson school thats a pretty large corporation yes it is and uh retirements one of the good benefits and um health care has been a mess nooh yeah and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think thats a mess for everybody now isnt it pretty much yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around it keeps i yes for the best where it used to be one of your better you know you you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didnt have that problem yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one yes i think i do ive never worked for a small one so i cant tell you you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system well i think uh course im im a medical technologist and and in our line of work its awfully nice to not be out by yourself and thats the biggest benefit i find because um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations right right do you have good resources in your school district right we do have very good resources theyre excellent yeah to my mind thats the best thing for working for a big place and theyre um is how about you how do you feel about that well its an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it it is an important aspect as far as um being having having everything available to you the uh counseling and the whole whole ball of wax um umhum what would you like to change in your benefits well probably the major one would be the medical i would like to change see a better package for the money you know it but but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the do you have to pay medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you dont get any of that any more you know its all separate and its all so very high if you do get it yeah well ours is and thats very frustrating and it i cant imagine how the younger families do it well its its difficult laughter i know uh ours has improved over what it was because we just went to a larger corporation and thats what helped it improve but the one thing id like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost laughterpathetic so thats how id like to improve ours umhum i was i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and its not good though weve had to i mean were building our own you know oh well you have to you have to any more you cant count on companies on that any more that and thats another thing thats changed the the medical and the uhhuh you have to if youre smart retirement benefits from large corporations its kind of its its like it was set you know you were really set for life really well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and uh uhhuh yeah yep yep thats right right before yeah and thats thats kind of rough  thats yeah i remember um my mother talking in the forties for her her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that theyre doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and thats what theyre doing again its like a recycle of the whole when they see theyre gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or its getting close to a time yeah it happens they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they dont have to pay as high and yeah but uh course i think theyre losing an awful lot of valuable expertise oh vocalizednoise i do too and the wisdom behind it all its yeah and you know thats got to count thats got to add in all their production the whole works i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it yeah it was uh its expensive and i dont know why they dont build that into it but i guess well its cost again you know cutting costs

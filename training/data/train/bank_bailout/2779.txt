now we have to talk about the savings and loans scandal laughter oh my goodness do you have any strong opinions on that oh absolutely uh what are yours i i think uh its all Congress fault well i think theres a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water yep and i think the real problem wasnt the regulation which i supported but that they failed to similarly deregulate the insurance i mean i think that was the real mistake they should have seen that coming its that was like giving away free money oh sure well continue to insure insure you cheaply but you can you know do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and it shouldve been do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and by the way when you buy insurance you know theyre going to be looking at how you do it hell pay for it right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure theyll pay more for insurance uhhuh i think that wouldve been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that wouldve helped a lot would be to make certain that  the people who were going to use the money that we were providing shouldve had there own at stake they shouldve have a lot more of their own capital on the line when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and its turning out to be a lot more than that and vocalizednoise they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it absolutely because i mean their return is guaranteed they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then oh if people dont pay them back its no skin off their nose they just sure in fact theyve got a strong incentive to uh you know guarantee your money your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in you know the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is high uh because if they win they win big and if they dont who cares laughter they dont loose right yes they dont they dont lose anything well uh i dont know what couldve been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told upfront that that was was was the limit yep yep i agree with you there too uh because uh the promise is vocalizednoise this this the whole concept of too big to fail its just silly yeah the promises dont mean anything now when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have thats right and i also think the first thing they shouldve clarified was that the tax payer would give you a hundred thousand dollar maximum i dont care how many accounts youve got uh i wouldve been in a little danger of uh you know i wouldve had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return thats right and i mean it wouldve put these money brokers out of business on a CD yeah uh i dont think thatd be any great loss laughter we could do without a few of laughterthose they dont seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people which i mean certainly contributed umhum i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know its its not just the responsibility of the broker its your responsibility you know to know what youre investing in and the kinds of risks youre taking and it seems to me if youre going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limits going to be in a bank that you should be aware i mean its one thing to have insurance when youre protecting the little guy who doesnt have the time to make or the expertise to make these sorts of decisions but its another thing to be you know supposedly you would think hope that the big depositors like voters and everybody else are supposed to be educated about what theyre getting into yes you would and uh uh i dont see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i i mean in a uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that right absolutely uh there are no guarantees on them thats right you uh you trust that the broker wont sell because certain brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then youre uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under thats right yeah yeah i mean there is like for the brokerage houses there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage wont go bankrupt and youll lose your money but theres certainly no guarantee that for example uh the commercial paper that the money market you invest in wont become worthless and your and your stock price will go down thats right and thats fair enough umhum  well uh do you think that were heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry uh yes i mean theres got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because and we see reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right um so i mean this things just got to spread well i dont know how were going to bail them out because if were already how many trillion dollars in the hole wheres the money going to come from and yet the weve got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um maybe the people who uh bought term insurance arent going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i dont know whos going to bail them out yep its a problem there already there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time and the the state governor is saying that were going to protect those people but how are we going to do that where the state itself is already in hock uh were running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year and you know weve got to come up with that money because states cant run a deficit the way the federal government can and theyre going to have to be laying people off out here in the state some of laughterwhom i laughterdont think anybody will laughtermiss but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference umhum well if only it would help you know pull the usual firemen for a scam well the pay more taxes if the firemen go first yeah i think thats absolutely vocalizednoise they keep all their fancy uh perks in the legislature and they uh still do their vocalizednoise and they still have all their uh i think its something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator yeah i i came from out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people consistently voted it down and since they laughterdo laughterenough laughterdamage laughterevery laughtertwo laughteryears laughterthink laughterof laughterwhere laughterwed laughterbe laughterif laughterwe laughterlet laughterthem laughtermeet laughteryearly thats right laughterand i really feel that way about the California ones too that i i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over but anyway laughter i think constitutional congress would be probably a good idea yep i i would vote for that umhum  well its been interesting talking to you and i think were in pretty much agreement on this laughter yeah its been good yep i think so too thanks for talking uh bye bye well see you bye

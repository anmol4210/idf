well i guess you said that youre youre a uh youre engaged so you really dont have a a family budget to manage right now right uh i dont have a family budget but we do have a laughterbudget laughteralready to were paying for our own wedding and everything well thats good right oh thats good so youre really planning on uh how to how to manage money from the beginning and thats a a good time to start uh weve been married twenty five years and uh we find that uh you know money management is is really important we uh dont have a lot but we still you know manage it fairly well we dont have a formal budget uh we have just found that uh by trying to practice uh paying our bills every month uh especially our credit card accounts uh we dont spend more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of that month or when the bill comes we find that that works pretty well for the most part excuse me are are you planning on having a a real budget and and setting up a monthly monthly amount to spend or uh i myself i dont do it ive been paying for my own college education also for the past four years  so uh and my parents also have been married for twenty five years and i kind of picked up what they do they really dont have a formal budget like you do and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in you know and they just make sure they dont buy over and im pretty much like that also i dont buy a lot of luxury items i buy what i need and i buy it when its on sale you know and i i dont go out of the way but my fiancee now he has a set budget that he goes by and he allots so much to each thing and it works out good for him but i think whenever like for the wedding were doing this you know the wedding money were doing together and uh weve actually sat down and wrote out how much everythings going to cost and you know making sure we have enough for everything and going from there well now then i guess thats really you know the the idea of budgeting we know you know how much moneys going to be coming in and we know what we have to spend so we dont uh you know we dont go out and spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else and uh i guess thats a budget in in a sense its its strange im an accountant and my wife manages most of the money so you know i manage other peoples money but or or you know help them manage their money so i kind of let her manage ours and then you know if theres any questions come up you know we discuss it and work things out whatever needs to be worked out uhhuh well see uh well like i said he he does computer hes with computer work and im a finance manager but uh we decided that we would kind of share like the books you know he he he doesnt like the idea that i would just do all of it and i dont mind you know him helping with it either i think its just pretty much going to be i think most couples you know its not its its not like one person doesnt know whats in there at any time you know right it yeah you you have to i think thats the the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are then theres not ever any you know any uh question about whether or not the money can be spent or whether its being spent properly or if one person knows that uh that if both parties know that what has to be spent then theres not going to be ive already said that no questions and and then plus if theres ever any uh you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to its uh ive seen it uh seen it happen where you know people been married twenty twenty five years and  one one party or the other managed the the money and you know something happens and the other one was left not knowing what was going on so you really need both of them  yeah well hes been on his own for probably oh its been four years now so he is able you know to manage  the money uh since weve decided to get married and stuff he hasnt been as carefree with his money like he used to he used to be really carefree with it and like i well my my i came from a family we my mom had twelve children and my dad didnt start out as a out as with a high paying job you know so she cut pennies wherever she could you know and i ive learned that from her and and its really helping out now because in the you know yeah in just in the in a matter of a year and a half weve weve been managed to save its going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding you know and were talking five or six thousand dollars saving in a year and a half yeah well thats great yeah so thats thats pretty good and its you know its good that youve got that that uh background of of managing and saving as much as you can with todays economy because you know things are so uncertain that you really have to watch you know be prepared to you know to cut spending when you have to but uh you know its money managements really an important thing you know with todays with the situation the way it is uhhuh and i know a a lot of couples starting out uh i dont think they really think about saving any either you know and uh now i know you know as my mom and dad thats been a big part on them and i think it will be a big part on us also but i know a lot of couples dont even think about it or retirement or you know or in case an accident would occur yeah most most young young couples starting out think uh well ive got you know forty years before i need to think about retirement so they they plan on waiting laughter you know half of that time and so they wind up when they you know twenty years later and theyve already reached that point where theyre spending everything theyre making yeah and they say oh well we have the money we might as well spend it now laughter yeah and they well they they got their uh their lifestyle geared to to spending everything and they cant cut back enough to start saving so if you cut back to start with you you know youll find youll be surprised at how easy it is to you know if you start off saving and just continue to do that yeah it is really pretty easy i mean myself im a college student and i get loans you know i i dont receive grants but i do have loans and just in the matter since uh Christmas ive managed to pay about five hundred dollars on my wedding dress myself you know and it its amazing where you can cut your pennies and you know so thats thats real good well any other anything else that we want to talk about on budgeting no i we seem to agree on everything laughter yeah laughter thats thats good every once in a while you find somebody on these conversations that you dont agree with everything have to bite your tongue but laughter well i really cant think of anything else on it well its been nice talking to you its been really nice talking to you too uhhuh byebye yeah okay thank you byebye

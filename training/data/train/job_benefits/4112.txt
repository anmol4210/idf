 right now im at um University of Pennsylvania im a graduate student and the benefits that i get are very minimal but i do get my health insurance paid for but i dont have any kind of disability insurance or um lets see no disability insurance no vacation well i get in a way i get vacation pay because i get to set totally set my own schedule not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal um im im a coop student at GTRI uh i go to school at Georgia Tech and we dont have benefits to speak of we dont have health insurance or paid vacation and youre undergraduate student or graduate student undergrad yeah yeah here they for the grad students at least in physiology department which my degree degree granting department is biological engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesnt even do that yeah yeah but i dont know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now so that some people can get them and some people cant and its like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not itd be great if they had everybody responsible for their own health insurance and either that or what they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else well thats a good idea i had never thought about it that way i guess i would like to see something like that and then i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having instead of um a national health insurance system having a sort of like an FDIC for health insurers so if if youre health insurance company goes out of business you dont lose everything if you get sick right thats that would be a wonderful idea but on the other hand in in the current state of the current system ill whenever i get out of here ill look for a job probably an academic job that would you know benefits i dont know how important thatll be usually academic jobs you get TIAA for your retirement plan which is a its a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to i didnt know that a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking  good care of you i know my daddy worked for the federal government and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he went taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isnt particularly well she has um shes a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that now that her kidneys have totally failed theyve taken her off one of the drugs Lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture and her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month laughter so and thats the lowest its been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out oh im im just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and uh im not really all too sure what kind of jobs are available and uh i havent gotten them yet im going in a few and i i im going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see uh if research for a school would be something i would consider  hum what kind of company are you working with cooping oh oh its the Georgia Tech Research Institute its affiliated with the university um i see and uh we do research uh the one im in the lab im in does research in microwaves and antennas and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government so a lot of our uh expenses are you know covered by the federal government

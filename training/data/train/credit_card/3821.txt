credit cards laughter ill tell you what i i cant say a whole lot about credit cards because i uh tore mine up is that right i i know people i know some other people that have done that yeah uh i got in some problems with uh  financial problems because of credit cards so i uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and you know uh one that i use just for  emergencies but yeah i have i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and werent going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and theyre still paying away to get out of debt i know it  but no i did vocalizednoise just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh parents footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually but i uh i basically never charge anything i dont have the money in the bank to pay for and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah oh is that right thats a thats a good policy yeah and it you know i mean they theyre just a convenience for me i dont have to get cash out of the laughterbank and i dont have to to be writing checks and and uh yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases im glad i dont because i you know unfortunately i i i dont have the control you have laughter i wish i did but but i dont uh and it you know it i just dont want to get into that situation again so well yeah uhhuh yeah i mean it its easy i mean you you know you dont have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know laughter oh thats it see and thats even with my gas card you know i find that ill go in to get some gas and ill end up buying you know  candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and im thinking what did i get surprising laughter that costs so much yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there youre not going to youre not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right that thats true but i can i can understand certainly understand where  now i with the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know laughter not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly you know oh yeah isnt it thats unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you that i im uh thirty three thirty three thirty two excuse me vocalizednoise laughter  youll be thirty three this year laughter you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh its coming yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates its uh its unbelievable you know i just vocalizednoise that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and shes from there and and uh didnt really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but shes paying it and uh i just wont do it i mean shes paying i dont know i dont know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money ill go to the bank and uh oh jeez yeah and then you bet thats uh yeah i in fact ive ive even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh rates oh yeah and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know and i i guess theres some theres uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh call you know if youve got a pretty good rating uh credit rating you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or ill just go to somewhere else well i might you know and if youve got if youve got a pretty good uh uh history with them theyre more than willing to do that hum i might try that because i i have one card that ive had for about uh i dont know nine or ten years yeah in fact thats thats what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says thats you know hes tried it several with several of his cards and hes just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent it does not make sense for me to do that and if you wont drop my rates ill just go ahead and send you back your card and ill go somewhere else and get it yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i wont get any card now ive ive got a good rating and ive got laughter you know and im not going im not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first

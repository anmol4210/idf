so how do we fix the national budget damned if i know um laughter i dont uh i suspect uh lets see  i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows you shouldnt one shouldnt say that i i i suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money and work from there that would probably be good because i because i dont think theyre very good at it that the government hasnt been looking at the source of the problem the true source of the problem is A that we do spend too much but also B that we dont take in enough yeah well why why why why do you say that actually too few Americans are working if more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor and paying taxes rather than using taxed and the tax structure was fair between lowest and the highest income Americans then we would have more money there to play with oh thats interesting yeah thats probably true i mean well we also wed be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people arent working its back in the system so youre right thats a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise revenue i mean to raise jobs i wonder hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves but in fact in some cases thats what we ought to do oh okay so start when not Reaganomics thank you but that is not gonna work uh uh what i was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space and that way just create more jobs or whatever at some point there there will be most of the able ablebodied Americans hum umhum well thats a neat idea we also need to uh assure that theres some work in the private sector yeah thats what thats what you you think space would do that much for that or i think it would do something for it i think we would fill up new technologies but i think we should also do something rather radical like what legalize marijuana oh you think you think that would uh have a major effect well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway that that might have a um a good effect on on on crime anyway yes uh okay i think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals i think it would put reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another thats probably true i think that i think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax laughter and probably a lot of and probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from yeah but thats potentially you know uh if you look at prohibition its repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues umhum um no id never thought about that then i think once we put money back into the coffers in the coffers of the federal government and get the federal government to where theres money there again we should reduce the amount of money and this would have to come rather quickly and would have to come come originally also where were not paying in some cases we do pay more for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage thats true we do often times they are paid more yeah you cant deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means thats just sensible on their part thats just what on their part im sorry i missed that its just sensible on their parts to go after the the the greater amount of income so if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage more people will get off welfare that that maybe true thats very true you know give them a true incentive to want to work and then letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure exactly where were at with unemployment right thats uh or eliminate it entirely for a few years until we get our own house in order yeah and maybe even reduce along along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well i think oh absolutely absolutely i mean we dont need to buy other peoples stuff right now thats right when were in a world of hurt well i dont im not going to say that we ought to reduce reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely right well that thats what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite heavily i mean they tax American imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get it seems only fair right it does seem only fair i mean why not and i think really if we got all those that are ablebodied into the work force the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force there would be plenty of money i i think so and then at that point quit spending on space force it all into the into the private sector oh really oh really i love the switch well at that point you might we it it it wouldnt be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be thats right we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do but i think that would be uh uh space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work is compared to defense well thats a good idea well i well the other thing and the other thing i i i think we seriously need to do is um like i say have someone go in and look and you know and find out where it is were paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something you know what causes that greed i suspect uh no your your buying large trunk the government specification sheets of paper for building a pair of BVD underwear for the federal government is twenty two foot tall if it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another for making the government issue under wear for making government issue underwear to just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines costs the company a huge amount of money well its potentially a fault of the government than i mean that could be thing like that should be i mean yes a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor right well thats a i had never heard that before a huge amount of what you hear on about the seventy five dollar hammers and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesnt come from people in the industry it comes from senators that dont know anything about it my job is government tooling specialist oh okay so you know about some of these things yeah

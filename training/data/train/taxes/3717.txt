uh what do you how do you feel about it well i dont know i would hate i would rather not have to have it all taken out but i kind of feel like its part of living in a free country laughter but it seems like they take quite a bit out uh im a tax lawyer laughter and uh i uh oh yeah but i agree with you i uh you probably know like i say youre a lot more knowledgeable about it than i am but do you do for corporations or mainly yeah corporations i work for a bank oh do you oh yeah and uh so what what do they think the corporation you work with well banks banks are regulated of course by the uh by the federal government anyway so we dont have the franchise taxes which are  are not federal taxes uh i dont know i i think they i dont hear anything at work about them laughterreally yeah well i tell you i i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do oh okay whats the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i dont want to say battles but do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the unfair unfair uh unfair playing field and whatnot and whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get weve had that too because of the failures though oh yeah and uh whether or not they should be assessed more and uh the the state has uh has uh is in the midst of a reform probably in that area its where theyre going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund or or higher assessment to yeah huh yeah its uh i dont know i want i think ive always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldnt be but it seems like more and more uh were getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not uh i dont know that it is fair i think that its you know the way banking is being uh compacted i work for at Nations Bank which has just merged with C and S Sovran oh yeah and uh you know i think i think a little competition is good but down here a lot we saw laughter we say them doing things they shouldnt be doing yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the twenty uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not were yeah real estate you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff and i dont know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed theres no doubt about it everybodys gone down i think the individual levels are fine uh i dont think theyre perceived as uh was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know uh we wouldnt reduce the deficit laughterby but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean weve talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or well thats what sales tax are yeah thats true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh theyre debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesnt stimulate the economy that much it just uh laughterboots everybodys feeling about stimulating the economy yeah thats more or less touchyfeely thing as opposed to yeah i just always heard that the poor would end end up taking the worst brunt of it because theyre you know their their income is less and yet theyre being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know ive heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that itll be maybe a different level of tax but seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldnt do much anyway i i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct yeah thats true you cant take away people that said there you go youve got one exception already and uh and uh it you know well if we didnt have this exception then well just add this one and it just gets it snowballs yeah thats true i i think it is in theory probably a good idea well uh are the taxes in in Texas are they are few state taxes very high or we dont have state income tax oh dont you oh thats sweet  but weve got an eight percent state sales tax oh that hurts yeah and uh you know course thats thats a regressive tax yeah it is and its you know uh uh its not on grocery

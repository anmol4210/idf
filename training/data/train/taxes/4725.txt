 regarding uh taxes im you know taxes are really a necessary evil in in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because you its more efficient to do things yourself right hm and uh and so as as a result uh you know its its a tradeoff you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really dont deserve it uh well yeah laughter i know its its a lot you know that uh that i feel like you know just like you said that it theres just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you dont need the money for but theyre giving it to other people that dont really need it either either but yet they accept it well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know  vocalizednoise look vocalizednoise look look for uh look for people to uh take care of me and uh probably a good woman right  like so many people do laughter  laughterright laughter just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and then and and then you dont have to be on the tax roll but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing and everybody everybody really hates it it was very timely i i i always over pay my my deductions so i wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding so uh you know that thats always a smile but of course you know ive ive paid it in and i should calculate it better laughter you are you in business for yourself no i i i i work for the FBI okay i see so i im a federal employee yeah guess i dont sound like it huh laughter uh well i think i no i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know most of them vocalizednoise unless you work for Internal Revenue laughter yeah ive blown yeah oh i ive got all four feet in a trough you know being a federal employee and and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue you know i vote no on every one of them im i but but but this isnt this is tax not tax revolt country i mean theres too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know plus our snout right up to our ears so you know its not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation but uh um now the um the local taxes here i i in in this particular area um you know ive uh i think i pay about uh oh thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money and and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and and they theyre building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where its cheaper at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars im paying in taxes why i i i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right yeah thats right for you know instead instead its its the taxes here so course i dont know whether i wanna go to Bulverde or not yeah or Seguin or someplace like that but uh theres certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and i and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer if youre not gonna use them then you wanna be in in an environment thats a strategy i think that that the people you know have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living you know and im im five six away vocalizednoise years before im eligible to retire and and im saying well you know i really cant stay here uh as a retiree its too expensive after you retire yeah yeah yeah im gonna have to go out in and you know in  you know East Fork someplace and and and do my thing you know oh my parents are in the same situation you know they their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesnt feel like he can retire because they couldnt pay the taxes and they have no children in school or you know anything now they dont use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know and theyre not doing it again again you know so well its certainly uh uh you must be a TI employee uh yeah you must be what you must be a TI employee no im not laughter no i i dont work im a student i go to school im in nursing school youre not a TI employee who do you work for youre vocalizednoise

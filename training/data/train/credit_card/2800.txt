i dont guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies uh when i first got married was a Visa card uh issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City because my sister worked at the uh uh the Visa vocalizednoise Bank Americard center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there im not sure that i would have qualified theyve come in handy over the years  yeah uh and they have become or also a a real bother sometimes oh tell me about it laughter especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if youre on vacation its just easier to put everything on a card and uh i find if youre not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face and you go i dont remember doing all that stuff and it adds up yeah they add up quick so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh i kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases yeah we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies you know but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you dont watch it how how do you look at credit credit cards we just uh quit using them laughter and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off vocalizednoise thats we keep them uh we keep uh one gas card and uh and uh Visa just you know in case theres an emergency or something but other than that we dont use them anymore laughter  well thats kind of the way we were coming its its uh i guess for that very reason that that uh if youre not real conscious of what youre doing its just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid laughter i know isnt that funny laughter and i give them maybe not maybe theyre not really concerned about getting paid because theyre know if you dont then theyre adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent sometimes its twenty two percent interest yeah yeah and then some of them add late fees on it and say they dont get paid and i guess thats one of the motivations behind the the uh vocalizednoise the uh American Express card with TI theres no with the American Express card from TI theres no um uh uh late fee theres no uh interest rate you either you either pay the thing off or they come get it oh really and its turned into personnel and they come get you so theyve got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then oh yeah then some of the others do but thats the one that your cost center manager sees every month so youre a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to can you use that one for personal use oh yeah oh you can you can use it like any other card and uh oh i see huh but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those uh bills that come in and those statements youre not the only one you uh you want to make sure that vocalizednoise uh is that okay is that okay okay that okay those people see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is but most of the others ive sent back i mean all you get is card offers ive got three card offers now uh from gas companies and uh Visa Gold and uh some other bank uh Citibank i think is always sending the Visa stuff out and i usually just throw them away because i you know oh i do too i dont even open them much i throw them out i dont want another one i dont want to have to mess with it you know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards and uh one of these days its going to all be full a girlfriend of mine found uh uh it was a Visa or MasterCard she found the ad for one in like a Good Housekeeping Housekeeping magazine for eleven percent oh thats not bad so i said shoot i need one of laughterthose yeah no if they dont say no annual membership on them ill throw them away um years ago well that i had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for oh probably fifteen years and then they started charging uh annual membership fees and i said adios im you know im not paying you why do they do that its just another way to make money as far as i can tell i mean theyve been i mean i mean they get enough you know on the interest well sure and they i guess they figure theyve got enough people out there with cards theyre going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop theres going to be that much more uh so then a couple years ago i found uh a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership so i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my sons savings account in his name and got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee i it would be okay but i cant see paying someone to use their card be charged that eighteen percent interests no i cant either so yeah i think youre right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere yeah yeah really laughter gets a lot of people in in trouble yeah it sure does maybe theyre counting on that i dont know well i guess thats it thanks for talking okay nice talking to you

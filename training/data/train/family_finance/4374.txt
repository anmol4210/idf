 okay okay what do you do we use a monthly budget um my husband and i my husband works i dont and um he brings home the paycheck laughter and we have a budget or a balance sheet is what we call it we have different columns for different areas of our budget and we budget out a certain amount for each month or each pay period and then we try not to go over that laughter and so anyway what do you do well when when i was married my husband budgeted you know very very tightly but then every time there was any uh and he made sure of it if there was any extra money for anything he spent it oh laughter right so you know that that type of budget i didnt function you know i didnt uh i felt like i was getting the short end of the stick right umhum you know so uh but im im divorced now so i dont even have a bank account i have a my the company that im working for has a credit union and i put in the credit union every week a substantial amount of my check and then when i have some extra monthly uh or quarterly bills like insurances and taxes and things like that then i draw out of that savings account to cover those extra expenses and uh i you know im still very uh very tight with my money course i make very little also but i couldnt i just couldnt stand the pressure of having a checking account and being concerned about having a check that wasnt covered because theyre really expensive down here on a you know if you if you misfigure your check you on a ten or twenty dollar check any any size check it could cost you easy fifty dollars to get it oh my God uhhuh straightened out so and my my budget doesnt have stand for that so uh but ive i save uh uh i havent the last two years i have saved in an IRA every year uh saved enough money to to buy an IRA you know to pay for a two thousand dollar IRA every year and um im in the credit union uh not the credit union the company uh savings and investment plan now thats a good idea and i save six percent there i actually save nine percent there they add three percent to it so uh im you know im uh youre set well im im saving you know i even even though i make very little money and and uh you know and me and its its me and my daughter and uh so uh you know im doing better laughternow better im came out of of a job that paid very well like for down here i made twenty five to thirty thousand a year and my ex made uh under forty and now the first year i was out on my own i made four i made twelve thousand yes it was tough and last year i got a promotion and a raise and and a better vocalizednoise different a better job and i made seventeen so uh im doing better uh and but im still saving more money now than i did when i was married yeah well i think that one thing that people dont do a lot of these days a lot of people just live from paycheck to paycheck and dont have enough to put away they do here they you know a lot of people i mean they are and every time they have uh like a car break down or their taxes come due or vocalizednoise all kinds of stuff they would our credit vocalizednoise the credit union at the company that i work for was was more like a loan shark it was awful they wouldnt they didnt have to follow uh regulations of any kind oh uhhuh and so the people would would every time they had trouble they didnt have to manage their money theyd just have to go sign their life away and and get money from the credit union and they just they ended up a lot of them ended up owing more at the credit union than they could then they could ever pay and they wouldnt get very much of a paycheck at all because of the credit union taking so much out and and they didnt werent willing to manage their their checks you know and uh but i it was pitiful i mean you think good grief yall what is your you know why but uh well i wasnt brought up this way to budget thats for sure my husband was and and it was really an adjustment period for me to learn how laughter but i could see the wisdom in it well if you exactly you know if you are not willing to budget your money then you uh you know if youre not willing to be careful and live on what you make

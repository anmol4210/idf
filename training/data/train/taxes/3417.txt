 um i guess my  initial view is our tax burden hasnt gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in in the world and in part of the matter you get what you pay for were gonna have national health insurance which seems likely its necessarily gonna involve more taxes uh i suspect they take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh  energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes thats the direction we should look right well i guess i kind of have mixed feelings laughter um you know you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it and you wonder you know wheres it all going and we have such a huge uh national deficit and where its all going and i guess a lot of times theres questions wondering well if its doing a whole lot of good i know theres a lot of social programs out there that need help but you kind of always wonder well where wheres the money going laughter well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into into a big trust fund but that is a particularly regressive tax uh its a tax on the first dollar earnings and Senator Moynihans uh proposal to to to cut there i think would makes a lot of sense im sorry i couldnt i couldnt hear that i think Senator Moynihans proposal to to cut the social security tax which isnt really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense right right yeah i agree with that  as far as other countries im not um i dont keep up on it too much just as laughterfar as what you know as what theyre doing i know we were in Ireland last year and i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here but oh yes but as far as other countries im not uh up to par on laughter i think Japan i think Japan is probably about equal to ours and other major countries are higher i had friends were amazed at the sales taxes the classes of things when they went to Canada vocalizednoise not so long ago and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services and its a real real theyre theyre real tradeoffs there yeah but and and you sit there and wonder um i guess this doesnt really have to do with taxes but just money in general and and um wondering if youre gonna have enough when you retire laughter to live on uh i that thats a scary thing with this no no real knowing about uh the the theres a lot of inflation risk that isnt taken care of in most private pension plans yeah thats true but um are you involved with the legislature up there or since  no im at the National Institute of Standards and Technology uh theyre part of the Commerce Department here in vocalizednoise here in in Gaithersburg Maryland uhhuh i was just wondering since you said Washington DC and you and you picked this topic i was laughterjust kind of curious  well well i i i didnt pick it uh oh you didnt i um i like i dont really recall what i may have filled out on the on the form but i i certainly think certainly been given topics different from the ones that id mentioned before oh did you see i havent placed any calls did they automatically assign the topic yes yes when you place a call topic is given to you oh i didnt know that i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic because i havent made any calls yet ive just received some oh you should try it oh i didnt realize that laughter okay laughter yeah because its kind of a it can be a rather controversial subject depending on who youre talking to laughter uh many of the subjects are uh and taxes taxes especially um one thing that has kept kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the is the level of defense of the defense budget and thats that same subject

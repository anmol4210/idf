well Bonny how do you do your budget we take the rent first you know we need to have a roof over our head and then we take the car you know we need a car to get back and forth to work and then its the utilities and then the food and then uh the regular bills you know your credit cards and your uh utilities and stuff like that i im trying to think what else phone the phone utilities come last or uh before lets see the utilities come before the food and the bills the uh credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans things like that they come before the uh uh they come after everything else theyre last on it because you know uh they theyre never late but theyre the least uh bothersome bothersome to us you know uh we need a roof and all that before we need anything else yeah i kind of think you ought to make make them wait until the last possible minute for it we do ours uh fairly similar course uh we both have married before and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills yeah well im a homemaker myself so he he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it should be and or the way whatever way we can i wish we could do that unfortunately between two divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good i can imagine i uh you know i havent gone through a divorce myself ive only been married once but uh i know a lot of people that have and a lot of thems got alimony and child support and all that oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about uh three thousand dollars a year for child support yeah i bet which is after i mean thats net thats thats right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it well thats better than having them living with you laughter theyre more expensive right there day in and day out thats what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff yeah i bet you do yeah but you know you know bills wise uh we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and uh my wife takes some of hers and we have an agreement that uh if were going to charge anything over like seventy five or eighty dollars then vocalizednoise we uh we talk about it yeah oh well me and my husband unless of course its uh its like for a present or whatever and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here laughter i love it when my husband decides to to say fudge with the budget and uh sneak a big gift in yeah i uh i was trying to finagle our budget around because uh my wife wanted she really wanted a little small five inch TV she could carry around the house or you know back in her sewing room whenever shes watching television ive got one of them and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money and so all through the year i i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come Christmas time were going to have that television set come hell or high water and sure enough we got it  well uh my motherinlaw gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago i dont think its five inches i think its a little bit bigger than that but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity so its a neat little thing to have how how do you divide uh you just divide up your uh the money just you just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there huh uh well they have we have direct deposit that helps a lot uh and uh first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead and uh you know he makes the same amount every week uh hes not its not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much hes going to get unless he works over and then its uh you know thats extra uh but hes got us situated to where we pay uh pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month and uh none of thems ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh it works out real well uh most problem we had was when uh lets see when was it something like we had a three pay uh weekends uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period and uh we was close to being uh oh shoot im trying to think its been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff and so that was pretty bad but i dont know i like that hes got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard hes got a stable schedule then everything kind of works out well yeah pretty much uh with the direct deposit thats what helps you know because he doesnt have the money in hand yeah if if if you dont have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well ill take five or ten dollars here oh well hes hes we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work and thats hard you know uh im sure youre vocalizednoise familiar with TI up here oh yeah and you know how they got the Texans uh that Texans Credit Union uhhuh Tex Tower yeah right there he uh hes good at uh getting into that but hes good hes you know we never in my i ive been married to him for seven years and weve never had a check bounce thats good and uh well no i take that back one time we did uh it didnt bounce but it came close we called our landlord and asked her to hold off on check cashing the check for three days laughter we was overdrawn six dollars thats not too bad that thats cutting it pretty close though  but uh it was i dont know weve never he weve had problems meeting our bills before but uh weve met them well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now not too much you can do about it between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does yeah thats whats going to hurt us in April uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt oh yeah so do we and yeah thats taking money that we didnt have you know that we had set aside for uh a bill or two and were trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by April yeah they want their money real quick thats the only bad part we got the same problem however i guess it uh beats the alternative just not having anything to start out with well i know how it is to start out with nothing uh you know oh yeah and uh im were up to where close to where we want to be but were not quite there yet well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it yeah i just can i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job but then id rather be with my kids well you know kids are important you got stay you have to stay home with the kids yeah well you know ive got a two year old and a four year old and uh well soon as they get in to school it wont it wont be so bad yeah but i know it would help with the bills well Bonny it it sounds like a pretty good idea tell you what uh i think we about done our about five minutes okay well it was nice talking to you okay well check you later all right byebye

okay i guess were going to talk about budgets and spending and keeping laughter oh okay i dont have a set budget i just laughter know what i have coming in and i know what i have to keep in reserve in order to survive well i have i uh  i have one oh written out but just basic things but what always ruins mine each month is all these other things like car repairs and unexpected expenses yes yes yes yes the things that crop up that you didnt plan for right i i just have mine all written up if i didnt have any of those it would laughtercome laughterout to laughterthat laughter so thats why we always have to have a reserve somewhere so we can not be caught shorthanded right right i also keep uh all my finances i make a big chart at the beginning of the year and each column you know is each different expense and then i add them up at the end of each month so that and i post it kind of from my checkbook i see and then i add them up at the end of each month so i do know exactly what i spent and then i can look at my chart and see what i spent where uhhuh do you and thats the way i do mine do you kind of forecast yourself for the year or not make a forecast of what you think your expenses and then compare what the actual costs are yeah i can do that because i can add across then for twelve months you know on my chart i can add it up at the end of the year and see what i but you but again when you say budget that budget that i make thats supposed to work for the year it doesnt have all these extra things on it that laughtercome up like we spent eighteen hundred dollars last month getting our shower redone you know things was your shower pan out of kilter um oh we had a leak and the tiles just all started falling in oh my uh and this the third this house is eighteen years old and its the third time its happened the first time it was the pan and then the next time it was termites and then this time i think it was just some kind of a leak laughterbut laughteranyway anyway uh our house is to an age that that a big part thats not budgeted is have to use for repairs you know it really is a shame the way they build houses though because you can go over to England and look at those castles that are four and five hundred years old and theyre like you know so like a Rock of Gibraltar theyre so steady and steadfast and just rigorous constructed and our homes here in the States you know theyre made to a good wind would blow them over yeah laughter laughterthats true which is really a shame for the to speak of the building industry like that yeah yeah things do i mean the all wear out fast well much faster than they did when i was a child growing up i mean those houses were made to last now where did you grow up in Detroit um uhhuh okay so youre used to homes with basements and that sort oh yes solid foundations and wet plaster walls and hardwood floors and the whole bit yes well maybe homes for have always been built more sturdier in the north than down here because of the snows and winters and everything well i see i dont have anything to base that on because i was an adult when i moved here ive been in Dallas about twelve years and you know i havent really seen um a quality home even the homes that i see that are that theyre building out in North Dallas where theyre paying just thousands and thousands of dollars for theyre using plywood on i mean pressed board on the roof if i was the buyer id have a fit theyre not even using a pure wood product plywood plywood is that what what well no not not plywood pressed wood you know where they take all these remnants and press them together i wouldve i would have a complete fit if i saw my new home being built like that i guess so many people dont know that much about construction that they know what these things to look for i think we should have steel girders in our homes and therere not i i just um its just its ridiculous i just feel very very disheartened about about the way i see the building industry go no wonder you know the hail damage is so extensive and and things like that where it shouldnt be and your homes if they catch catch on fire they go up within a matter of minutes rather than you know uh it takes a long time for the fire really to get a hold oh yeah yeah we because theyre inferior theyre using inferior inflammable material our uh the house next door to us burned a few years ago but what really got it we had wood shingles all wood shingle roofs in this neighborhood well see they should have known that they should have made uh they should have dipped them and and prevented and made them fire proof they they knew you know they knew i mean you know where are our engineers at our building engineers well you know maybe maybe there should just be um laws or something that the builders specifications that they have to do well yeah there are codes well its their the building codes and the building laws are too slack thats whats wrong theyre not stringent enough theyre not after the consumer theyre after the builder theyre protecting the builder and not the consumer oh definitely right yeah i know it well i guess weve kind of gotten off the subject laughterhavent laughterwe laughter we should have been talking about laughter home repairs laughter no yes we did we we got caught we kind of oh dear i hope we we dont dont get in trouble well if but as far as a budget goes i do not have a budget i just know what my income is and i have X number of dollars um dedicated to a savings program and X number of dollars for contribution and but thats automatically in my brain so its not written down on paper im so used to it that um well i guess the thing we do if were when were short we have one of these uh line of credit uh accounts at uh First City in Richardson its like for ten thousand so if so if we like we had to buy a new roof a few months ago that was four thousand dollars uhhuh uhhuh well something like that we put on that line of credit and then we try to you know pay it off is that as we can you know thats how thats what we do with laughterwith with things we cant afford i guess you would laughtersay so your uh so the

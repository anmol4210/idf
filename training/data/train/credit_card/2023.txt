all right uh weve got a lot of them laughter too many of them oh yes laughter and i believe we all do and and its just too easy to use yeah well my husbands real good at using them laughter oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much i dont have any of them i dont carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him um it uh vocalizednoise you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact id rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas uh yes and uh thats got us in trouble yes thats uh real easy to do i have to watch it laughter yeah in fact yeah uh laughterwe i can understand that predicament they theyve um you know theyve theyve made them too easy to and too accessible at everything to to buy the ATM machines oh yes those things there thats what gets us and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down well no he doesnt have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records oh uhhuh oh thats good but uh he knows when hes overspends and when he doesnt and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card laughter you know ive used the credit card a couple times to pay bills oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan yeah thats what hes talking about doing now oh no um yeah the ATMs theyre but theyre nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me laughter oh thats the best way laughterits laughterused laughter laughterthats laughterthe laughterbest laughterway laughteryes now i think that sort of evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something i dont know i like that he walks in you know and hes got this little gift and howd you pay for it credit laughter laughterhe laughteryou laughterknow said whipped out my little card and see theres no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it yeah id never thought about that way i dont really look laughter i guess i ought to sometimes oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo those are fun you get started on them and cant quit like credit cards laughter oh no never thought of it that way either hes you know hes addicted to it at times laughter just exactly oh its its real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you dont have to write a check or anything and see the thing is you know he go out and hell spend it when he wants you know and uh uh im afraid to im afraid to use that credit card yeah is there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and hes not a yeller though but he calmly you know you shouldnt have spent it all on that yeah they he likes to buy the kids toys  with the uh credit card too you you know hell go to by WalMart or something and oh yeah thats it oh yeah theres thats a weakness there thats just you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you dont care how much it costs or what it takes yeah well uh i dont know the uh uh the my WalMart thats where all of our bills are for the credit card yeah thats uh i always end up going into WalMart and vocalizednoise coming out with everything that uh i didnt have on the list were just getting more than what we went in for laughter laughterbut we went in for uh uh something for the car one day the last week and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those Ninja Turtles for my son uh you know the potty chair for my daughter and he bought the a pair of shoes for me and uh lets see what else did he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it and uh oh yeah its dangerous laughter laughteryou laughterknow we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up sixty seventy dollars for uh at WalMart and then we went to Payless and bought the shoes for the kids laughter umhum oh yeah its just too easy to do you go in for just one thing were were infamous about that and so yeah ill second that oh well yeah i well im im glad we have credit cards thats uh because in sometimes when theres an emergency it it comes in handy its nice to have i know we had the car break down one time and the uh credit card saved us weve yeah weve had uh vocalizednoise a sick animal and uh the vet you know the dog and vets are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldnt do without them i dont think wed live huhuh no no i think its become too much of an everyday life here theyre part of it yeah well ive been asking my husband for the credit cards ive got all of them but one i just hide them from him and when i feel that its necessary to pull it out ill pull it out but he keeps one of them he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh the balance credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the one with the least amount oh yes uhhuh so you know he cant spend too much yeah you know uh i dont really exactly remember how much it is i think its about five hundred limit uh you know its just uh just one for him to fiddle with yes umhum i have to think of something else im im blank i was i was just uh oh well lets see i guess weve talked what almost five minutes well six minutes ive got a timer on my uh clock on my phone oh i wish i had one of those well we bought this with credit too laughter well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh oh

topic so well uh you know we got to get back to credit cards laughter yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think weve pretty much said it all it vocalizednoise um but so uh but yeah uh i think we couldnt make it without them i know i couldnt uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out and uh thats got us in a little bit of trouble now thats why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there yeah yeah but uh we uh we try to keep a uh tight controls over uh over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays uh uh my hubby does not have uh too much control when it comes to using that card uh laughter i know uh uh for quite a while we was using them to uh uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent oh goodness you know it uh when we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was  paying the rent plus trying plus trying to get the money for another car another car and it gets rough it got it got real rough thats hard he just popped out that uh Master Card and get that cash advance uhhuh yeah we got a big cash advance and really thats whats uh holding us back now thats yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do theyre worth it oh well i i think weve pretty much come to an end here yeah im trying to find out how long were supposed talk i think it was at least five minutes wasnt it thats what im looking for now thats why i was just trying talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing

so what do you think about the uh income taxes well i could do with a lot less than that where do you live i live in Dallas okay i live in Dallas too oh good well i live in Plano in that case laughter  okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i oh yeah i do yeah yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax it i think its like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there Washington DC was only six percent and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half i know it was only four percent and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i dont know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and thats how it started with uh four percent five percent umhum umhum and all of a sudden here we are now and its horrible since theres no uh state tax i assume that thats why it went up fast because Virginia does have a state tax  well its true but they did without it all those years umhum hm and they keep talking about the state tax and theyll probably put one in and theyll have this too so  yeah it  if they put state tax in i mean ill be pretty upset because i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck uh every two weeks and uh  if that comes back in ill be pretty mad because sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know so uh i dont know im not very much for a for state tax well i hope it doesnt but you know how it goes so laughter yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing theyre putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because of that yeah they said uh to build okay raise them apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes but it seems like it would pay itself off oh well it will so you know laughter whats the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know probably the first season yeah so you know but theyre funny about things like that here yeah things like that you know they really are when i came here you couldnt buy beer couldnt buy a drink laughter nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know no huh so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws umhum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesnt bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe but uh  like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh oh that is on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year and thats a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you dont forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year that is but that gets real expensive oh yeah that is do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know uh uh they well they do a little bit but um its its like next to nothing ive seen it its on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks it costs what so its only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they wont renew your registration till you pay your property personal property tax and i had a i vocalizednoise i paid you know twelve hundred dollars laughtera laughteryear for my last car for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess thats not too bad but other than that everything worked out yeah so you havent been here very long whats that you havent been here very long ive been here about two years now two years but uh in the two years ive ive been here ive been through ive had two cars so ive never really like you know i dont know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax uh yeah on the car other than what i paid when i registered uh registered the car so thats the only thing i can really think of so so do you work for TI or you just doing this no i dont im a nurse i work down at Presbyterian okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought itd be kind of cool yeah oh it is you know theyre supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least thats what i heard that you could could get to do ten calls oh do they really yeah i i dont know how the thing works uh and this is like the seventeenth oh really laughter all right you yeah so its great

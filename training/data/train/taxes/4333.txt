 Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or or or what do you think well thats laughter thats a really hard question i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths um  i lets example uh our our friend the President right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases so uh i know the politicians uh arent arent straightforward now in in terms of economics im not its hard hard to call it really is see i never thought really its uh  i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not were paying too much or too little i i always thought that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment for instance like Social Security tax or Social uh i mean thats thats tax were paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us hm right laughter thats yeah i you know when i when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week i or each every other week i i really think that moneys history and you know so as far as return investment thats not thats nothing and were not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back yes uh uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh theres still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in DC that are researching to find a cure for polio which i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know and and staff it with people its really tough to close it down and and they just havent yet well yeah im not exactly sure uh about polio in particular i know we have a polio vaccine which will prevent somebody from getting polio im not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing somebody who has already gotten polio well that might be the difference i dont know uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on TV lately is uh had to do with its like seventy five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically that that historical for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians yeah its its its funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is been trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh congressional congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals and the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing so it sounds like you uh you think that that wed be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto i i think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste on the other hand uh uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things laughter right and just to get rid of the unimportant things and whenever theres that kind of subjective judgment  theres always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exactly where the boundary between waste and and necessity is so im not im not sure that that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is is a problem with uh i forgot theres a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something yeah pork barrel politics uh pork barrel politics there there there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh well i i lived in Massachusetts for a while and uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasnt necessarily so popular yeah but Massachusetts wasnt when Dukakis was there anyway wasnt in that great shape financially but at least at the end uhhuh i mean i dont know i yeah i i they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and uh thats part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out its uh i mean its its tough i mean theres theres two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that theyll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot and spare the economy yeah its really its a hard balance it it definitely is even not for government even just say for a small business um i know some

well the thing is is that uh since im in school i dont like basically have a monthly budget because im living off my dad but the thing is is that um i have to keep it under control because for example you know its like vocalizednoise the the beginning of the semester when you go have to pay for everything everythings pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever you know its like once the semester start im the one who has to control how much spending there is and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food and uh so what about tuition and rent who takes care of that well the thing is is that i live in a dorm so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts and the the tuition is also the same thing so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and thats about it but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because its like i cant go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week no cant do that very often so i mean its for for us you know its like i i can spend i can spend that money but its not its not what i want to spend it on you know are are are you working anywhere while youre going to school no because um they dont allow me to work since uh im a foreign student oh okay and so they the government doesnt allow me to work yeah so all the money comes from home so you got to make uh so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending well the thing is is that um i basically i basically know how much i have right and so the thing is is that i i can tell like uh i get all my money out of the teller and besides see one one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international where do you call to Argentina yeah Argentina wow and so the basic one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills yeah talk too long well thats they want they want me to call down there every so often i mean i told my dad listen dad listen if you want to save money i wont call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so it doesnt matter about the money because we need to hear from you yeah so you call him collect no because its more expensive that way uh any any uh basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of i would suspect so and uh because its considered luxury in other countries oh okay so you just call him direct and then right since its his money anyway you know yeah so that and he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him no uh i got money to pay that too so its basically you know its like its not too much money and its not too little money so i wont have to you know rush a letter to him or something because uh he really wants me to concentrate on my studies yeah what are you studying what are you studying im doing masters in computer science and computer engineering and what do you think youll do with that with those degrees well i can i can work up uh here up to a year and i mean and hopefully get a job after that you want to get into some kind of manufacturing or or whats the specialty that youre looking for uh computer communications and data transmissions oh okay so you want to find a uh data transmissions youre looking for uh long distance type stuff yeah you know anywhere from uh local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that and and so well you have a family right yeah i have uh wife and two children and uh and and does does your wife work no she doesnt work she does uh well its kind of hard to say now days uh other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself and she gets paid for that so she brings some money in oh okay shes trying to start her her own business where she does that full time uh alterations and sewing and stuff for the public and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town and so and you have a monthly budget well sort sort of were probably like most American laughterAmerican laughterfamilies i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much weve got at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget so so you dont have any problem in uh overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that oh sure were like everybody else you know you weve got a uh several credit cards that sometimes uh instead of paying them all off at every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time you know thats when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff yeah yeah well then uh see uh thats thats one of the points which i dont see like i i dont give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i dont want i dont like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know its like if i want something ill ill ask somebody you know like like my uh for Christmas for Christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want and i said i want a backpack you know uh no i told him you if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack yeah but something that you can use right because i i needed a backpack so he gave me a backpack and i i knew he needed an alarm clock so i bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that that thats very uh utilitarian you know right but you make those things there are no no frivolous gifts right but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down Argentina it was to me was ridiculous because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you dont care about you know its like thats true why bother yeah yeah and so but the thing is is that um well especially being a college student you your i dont know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time its the end of the semester youve got finals and youve got lots of bills i would suspect yeah yeah what about when you have breaks like uh Christmas or between sessions well for example we had spring break now and i went skiing and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars or i expect so so uh but you know its like uh youve got to budget that though youve got to save up in able to do that right yeah yeah because its like you know say you know its like were saying lets go eat out before spring break i go lets not go eat out before spring break lets see how much money we have afterwards i mean hm laughterhm laughteryeah right right and if i felt like i spent way too much then uh i wont go out you know and so like my roommate went home i went skiing in uh over the Carolina Mountains which arent anything but um but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it you know it was a nice place sure it is any time you can get away and and get away from from the daily grind yeah yeah yeah especially if you live on campus and you dont have a car you just go crazy yeah i know the feeling so oh well lets see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half okay yeah is that okay all right all right well nice talking to you all right byebye nice talking to you have a good time bye

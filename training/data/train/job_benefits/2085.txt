hi how are you doing uh i couldnt hear you i said how are you doing im doing fine im just uh editing a spreadsheet right now im trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work until im ninety five yeah weve been doing that too  were trying to retire in our fifties yeah this yeah this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because what im figuring out is that im going to have to put in a lot more money than what im making good luck on that one then whats that i said good luck on that one then weve got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our propertys already paid for you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits would be the uh  the availability of the health insurance and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer around inside the organization without having you know when they cut off a system and they dont just can everybody thats working on it like some companies i know of you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project so you work for TI then you cant say yep yes you do well i work for DISD and i dont know what youre talking about when you say um health insurance but Dallas doesnt pay it pays most of mine you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know my i put my kids on my policy its like two hundred dollars and its gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course its going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point and benefits you know id like to see child care paid for or or onsite child child care sometime i think that would be an excellent laughteridea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day yeah thats uh thats something i hadnt really thought about since we dont have children but i can see how it would be a real benefit those that do well we can shelter also monies that were going to pay in for child care too you know go on and pay a lump sum and as long as you pay that amount youre okay but if you paid in more than you actually used and the same thing for insurance what you predict youre going to be paying for insurance as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money youre okay but if you pay out less then you lose that money i dont like that part but you dont have to do that option if you dont want to well that can i can see where that might be important and then we got that cafeteria plan do you have that no you can uh i i dont know what youre talking about there well you lets see it shelters it shelters youre money that you pay for insurance it takes it out of your salary before taxes oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance but we call it the cafeteria plan i wonder why i said i wonder laughterwhy oh its probably what the first guy who did it called it yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of laughterit maybe so lets see what else can we do changes ill tell you what we could do we could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired because you know if you mean like for health insurance well not not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company and theyre not doing their job or theyre not capable of doing their job then we should find a a place to put them or b you know boot them out well thats easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what theyre getting paid thank you  i said thank you oh well were both school teachers im im but its hard to get rid of a teacher if theyre not good i know its almost impossible well theres two schools of thought on that you know i im looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that once you get that job with the university then youve got ten years of probation then you have tenure and they cant fire you well you know in a situation like that i dont know if thats good or bad i do know that ive had tenured professors that were just sorry and ive also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago you know for in the public schools but in addition it made you ease more at ease you know you knew you werent going to lose your laughterjob unless you really did something horrendous well they they really cant fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the governments taken care of that but uh what im looking at is you know there are a lot of teachers out there that arent getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that arent worth having around as janitors  right you know and i could see a point protecting someones position but on the other hand i dont think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all well they dont in some places they dont in some places they dont but you know you youve got specialized education now do they for instance take computer science you know weve got kids twenty years old right now that could beat any computer professor at microcomputer applications i know we do and these people cant even get jobs doing anything vocalizednoise besides digging ditches because theres no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to step to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college you know you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know its nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i laughtermean yeah laughter i mean my agree is absolutely worthless its my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards what did you get your degree in Industrial Marketing and whats your job now well actually im selling computer software but the two are mutually exclusive because the its experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college not my degree which is i think kind of bizzaro all right what else could we change  oh id like to see flexible hours and teaching you know shared job sharing well lets more of that weve already weve already got that well see weve got a little bit of it but not much and itd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing what else id like to be able to to evaluate your boss and it really carry some weight and you get to choose your boss well yeah supervisor evaluations always been a tough one especially in my line because you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check well so you get to evaluate him though why not well not really you know i mean it theres what whats to evaluevaluate evaluate him on you know i mean uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero i run the whole show and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what im doing you know and uh that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation because so often you know you get a guy whos got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak you know its its hard for me to you you know especially since im in marketing sales you know i make more than my boss  because hes salary and im not i make as much as i earn you know if i dont make a sale i dont make anything yeah well its a little tough but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who arent doing a damn thing theyre just there you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they arent working not that they arent trying or anything its just that their jobs are useless you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for Ed Swampers Swampers a guy whos in the union hes a laborer and hes assigned to

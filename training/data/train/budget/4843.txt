well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and laughter as it may be is to first of all put an end to these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh um other types of uh tricks that have been used to help mask the size of this thing lets get a hold of what the real true sized of it is and then lets deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible even if it means some short term higher taxes to get it down and uh then lets try to make some reforms with the the congressional community ha ha laughter try and make it so that we dont have this problem in the future well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor a situation where the revenue generation activities of the government such as the IRS are monitored and spending for year X plus one can go no higher than the revenues brought in during year X you know so that uh forget about this balanced budget this would immediately force them to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and weve only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh i realize that im off by a factor of about five but laughter we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million i i just keep seeing unfortunately the problem a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people bought into this notion that well we can just uh we dont need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and the deficit doesnt seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what its going to affect your kids yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead  vocalizednoise well i i think this has always been the case with the American public in that its made up of a bunch of special interest groups its only recently that special interest groups have started to exert more power uh for instance retirees theyve started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net but its not that way anymore uh now youve got people who have uh sixty thousand in tax free income because they invested wisely during their working years and theyre still collecting social security and all of that money is tax free im sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable and the thing is that you should loose social security benefits based on how much income you have yeah the only the only problem comes down as that a lot of people will scream and yell especially the AARP because they were yelled that well we paid for this all along was this a hidden secret tax the whole time thats our money that they dont want to give back to us now vocalizednoise uh yeah i i i i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh vocalizednoise tax and thats what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh uh you know i mean theyre treating it as a tax theyre treating the money as tax revenue its not something that theyre putting aside for later use it goes into the general fund whether or not it wants to to go there thats thats were it goes and its being used so i mean um uh my personal opinion out here in California we just instituted term limits on the uh Senate and House for the state legislature and i dont know whether its going to have uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my God you know youre going to have a bunch of amateurs running the state legislature well well so what laughter they cant do any worse than the guys that are in there now and vocalizednoise well yeah we have that out here in New York too you know with governor Mario King Mario and the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know laughter well i think that what we may end up with with the term limits is you get more people involved in government you get more people seeing how it should work and i think what that will do is that will allow people to say well wait a minute weve got to compromise weve got to work on something we need more of a vision and less of uh God ill grab my money and do everything i can

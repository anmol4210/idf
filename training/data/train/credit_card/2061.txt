 hello hey how you doing not bad not bad Whats your name Fernando my name is Nick wait let me turn off my stereo here because ive been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah man am i right what time is it over there are you are you in Dallas no no im in Detroit or not Detroit im in uh California are you yeah i because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas yeah im in North Carolina oh well youre on the uh lets see on the other coast laughter yeah twenty one yeah shoot man its what midnight almost what yeah yeah its uh im watching Saturday Night Live here laughteryeah okay all right well i guess were supposed to talk what about credit card what wait what what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and what what are you working on a a Masters in uh information systems really im doing my Masters in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering yeah where at at North Carolina State University hey how do you like it out there uh i dont because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i im in Raleigh and vocalizednoise Raleigh Durham yeah yeah that area and its really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill yeah so it its basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they dont have a whole lot there where are you at uh well im in Monterey California right now oh okay so so i mean its like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and thats about it two hundred fifty okay it its its a lot bigger than Monterey is but were just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco oh okay and its only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley no no i go to the its the Naval Postgraduate school out here oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley and theyre asking like for a um vocalizednoise GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like theyre looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and its like well thats what they look for whether or not they get it its hard to say  yeah i know thats why thats why i didnt apply i mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part yeah its pretty tough its pretty tough i mean uh lets face it you know and you know are you vocalizednoise did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know its what you do you know so uh i dont lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that so are are you going to go for your doctorate probably not see im in the Navy and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably wont do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy when do you get out oh probably be another twelve years oh okay laughter oh you know i like what im doing right now but uh but what if they pay for it  what if they pay for excuse me if they pay for a PhD nah they wont pay for it theyve i think they have maybe two people a year go vocalizednoise get their PhD because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um yeah they civilians or uh military i think i think theyre military but i mean the guy is still in and um he uh he works over in Maryland and so hes doing his Masters here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and hes doing it in like in a year and a summer and so hes getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that thats why you want to join but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once youve get your your you know Masters they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so well a lot of times its you know a lot of times its not the money that keeps people that keeps people you know they they like what theyre doing they you know they feel good about what theyre doing that type of thing its more but i mean i mean you the once you get your Masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year     oh easily im sure and thats not what theyre paying no well it depends on what rank you are of course yeah yeah laughteri laughterknow well i mean like i say if youre if youre you know if youre at an upper level in the rank category you know youre probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year but thats uh yeah those are few and far between though its uh its like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points and uh everyones a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money yeah i imagine its really competitive you know its like no i i mean IBM is like theres a joke about IBM which says you know its like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right and so IBM says well we have to we have to have a team right and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right so he goes have you come up with a solution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower laughter you know its like everyones a manager but you know its like only use like one person does the work so too many chiefs and not enough Indians yeah so yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down yeah that well thats the way it works i mean thats thats why theyre having problems i mean everyones a manager and i didnt realize that yeah i mean its like its like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know its like its like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank yeah push paper around you know like all these people are just standing sitting sitting sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go whats that this track which its going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time and so its like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff oh yeah theyve got a theyve got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you you you probably wont get fired for getting IBM material wheres if you try something different and it fails and youre dead theyll theyll say yeah why didnt you buy why didnt you try something more mainline yeah well IBM doesnt fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job which you you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit i mean thats their policy they never fire anybody unless youre caught doing something illegally illegal illegal or something like that yeah yeah like if youre stealing something or doing anything like that but they wont let you off what theyll do is like suppose you know like youre a manager so theyll put you into keeping up the paper you know its like how much paper is going in and then you say thats not my job so you quit so in other words thats the way they force people out  thats why they can say you know theres no layoff policy but it doesnt they dont really say that you know youre youre always going to have great career conditions yeah hey thats kind of sad no but i mean its like its like they they have like this different policy i dont know my dad works for them but its like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know its like they wont say well theyre the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it and so thats what youre gonna go for  yeah well you know thats thats a thats a big thing and and you know its like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge yeah they are out of Korea right leading edge dont they vocalizednoise they they made like uh small personal computers yeah small PCs arent theyre out of Korea right i dont know i i dont know but what they do is what they did i dont know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away oh yeah yeah because so is it like for example you test a chip it cant last seven years but it can last five IBM says lets throw it away Leading Edge will say well buy it from you and so thats i mean theyre still around i think  yeah ive seen well ive seen them around anyway you know vocalizednoise so thats what thats what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they vocalizednoise thats why theyre so compatible because i mean and by the time you have a computer for five years youre going to throw it away anyway most people do or they have to anyway you know vocalizednoise well i mean theres like when when you realize vocalizednoise teachers one of my teachers got this computer and which you know its like um voice uh synthesis and stuff  and he got that he said you know its like um i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory and i want more laughteryou laughterknow and its like Jesus Christ you know its like why do you want more because its like one second of recording i mean you put into a Wave and you want to correct the errors in the Wave takes so much i mean its like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by Markov model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know youre trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course its going to take a lot imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know its like laughter Jesus Christ thats amazing yeah well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory theyre gonna require yeah yeah yeah both vocalizednoise both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk memory disk base well like they say like nobody can get enough you know its like once you have something and its like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right well yeah you find out more and they were showing this like Three D graphics Three D graphics view of like like those hologram deals what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you like a hologram  just graphics on a on a

okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a computer here at the house and i made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month and then basically since then what ive done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on whatever weve got coming in check coming in and how much im spending each half of the month and then trying to also spend and because our house payment is once a month thats our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though its really still there so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do yall do a running total uh weve weve uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month and then uh weve at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend we sat down made up different accounts like you know weve set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close weve you know we we try to stay within a certain budget so umhum is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it it works out real well so umhum and and youre staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good yeah yeah i stay within i have to stay within it so i yeah i found you know and then we have that you know if you cant stay if something comes up and you cant stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and something unexpected unexpected comes up then youre not you know you dont feel it so strapped you dont have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that right yeah because we dont you know we dont charge anything that we cant pay off by the end of the month thats a good choice weve been trying were trying to uh do that this year weve budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a CODA account with TI and then money we were also buying stock with for that year weve taken that this year and said were gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh uhhuh baside you got paper under your table easide we have a another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that well be free and clear to be out of debt yeah the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment and thats the only thing we ever we try to stay out of debt so thats good to be in that kind of shape what are yall trying to do long term uhhuh oh as long term  we just he has you know his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that thats all weve and you know we just have our life insurance for right now so  we dont have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now so yeah mostly what were doing weve worked  weve done the uh CODA account with TI where they we put in so much a month and then they or so much a paycheck and then they  match it yeah thats what were doing  so  and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for TI and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an IRA and we had an out we had an existing IRA so we have both of us have some money in an IRA that were also trying to figure to put it were putting it in CDs right now and then were also looking at it in possibly getting a  mutual fund yeah whenever we get enough saved we we stick it in a CD for a while and then uh  umhum you know  and then when we if we need it we wait till it its expired and then so yeah  the other thing that weve done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um  Hancock oh  John Hancock company came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary  and uh what we were planning what what what our uh goals were on a long  term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time or not yeah uhhuh that sounds interesting weve never done anything we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know and hes set up uh  you know determined how much we need to you know we need if something were to happen yeah that you know thats the other financial thing i guess that weve done is with our life insurance is since im at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me right yeah you you know if i would sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldnt stay in Texas i would uh thats a a big thing to think about sell the house and move back home you know to my home town and and uh i wouldnt stay here in Texas so you know i dont know what he would do  but i guess thats most of my um financial plans right now is is there anything youd like to add yeah mine too nope thats about all for mine okay well its been nice talking to you nice talking to you too byebye ,family_finance,2022
all right uh weve got a lot of them laughter too many of them oh yes laughter and i believe we all do and and its just too easy to use yeah well my husbands real good at using them laughter oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much i dont have any of them i dont carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him um it uh vocalizednoise you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact id rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas uh yes and uh thats got us in trouble yes thats uh real easy to do i have to watch it laughter yeah in fact yeah uh laughterwe i can understand that predicament they theyve um you know theyve theyve made them too easy to and too accessible at everything to to buy the ATM machines oh yes those things there thats what gets us and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down well no he doesnt have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records oh uhhuh oh thats good but uh he knows when hes overspends and when he doesnt and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card laughter you know ive used the credit card a couple times to pay bills oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan yeah thats what hes talking about doing now oh no um yeah the ATMs theyre but theyre nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me laughter oh thats the best way laughterits laughterused laughter laughterthats laughterthe laughterbest laughterway laughteryes now i think that sort of evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something i dont know i like that he walks in you know and hes got this little gift and howd you pay for it credit laughter laughterhe laughteryou laughterknow said whipped out my little card and see theres no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it yeah id never thought about that way i dont really look laughter i guess i ought to sometimes oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo those are fun you get started on them and cant quit like credit cards laughter oh no never thought of it that way either hes you know hes addicted to it at times laughter just exactly oh its its real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you dont have to write a check or anything and see the thing is you know he go out and hell spend it when he wants you know and uh uh im afraid to im afraid to use that credit card yeah is there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and hes not a yeller though but he calmly you know you shouldnt have spent it all on that yeah they he likes to buy the kids toys  with the uh credit card too you you know hell go to by WalMart or something and oh yeah thats it oh yeah theres thats a weakness there thats just you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you dont care how much it costs or what it takes yeah well uh i dont know the uh uh the my WalMart thats where all of our bills are for the credit card yeah thats uh i always end up going into WalMart and vocalizednoise coming out with everything that uh i didnt have on the list were just getting more than what we went in for laughter laughterbut we went in for uh uh something for the car one day the last week and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those Ninja Turtles for my son uh you know the potty chair for my daughter and he bought the a pair of shoes for me and uh lets see what else did he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it and uh oh yeah its dangerous laughter laughteryou laughterknow we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up sixty seventy dollars for uh at WalMart and then we went to Payless and bought the shoes for the kids laughter umhum oh yeah its just too easy to do you go in for just one thing were were infamous about that and so yeah ill second that oh well yeah i well im im glad we have credit cards thats uh because in sometimes when theres an emergency it it comes in handy its nice to have i know we had the car break down one time and the uh credit card saved us weve yeah weve had uh vocalizednoise a sick animal and uh the vet you know the dog and vets are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldnt do without them i dont think wed live huhuh no no i think its become too much of an everyday life here theyre part of it yeah well ive been asking my husband for the credit cards ive got all of them but one i just hide them from him and when i feel that its necessary to pull it out ill pull it out but he keeps one of them he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh the balance credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the one with the least amount oh yes uhhuh so you know he cant spend too much yeah you know uh i dont really exactly remember how much it is i think its about five hundred limit uh you know its just uh just one for him to fiddle with yes umhum i have to think of something else im im blank i was i was just uh oh well lets see i guess weve talked what almost five minutes well six minutes ive got a timer on my uh clock on my phone oh i wish i had one of those well we bought this with credit too laughter well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh oh laughtersee laughterthere laughteryou laughtergo popped that credit card out it was a Sears laughter oh your up in Memphis no i used to be im in Texas oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far well i i dont know i dont know how far it goes yeah yeah im down in Houston are you in Texas oh im in uh down here in Sherman or Denison rather oh okay yeah umhum well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had first phone call this is my first one too my husband did one last night and he just loved it hes been getting he got a real good topic so well uh you know we got to get back to credit cards laughter yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think weve pretty much said it all it vocalizednoise um but so uh but yeah uh i think we couldnt make it without them i know i couldnt uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out and uh thats got us in a little bit of trouble now thats why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there yeah yeah but uh we uh we try to keep a uh tight controls over uh over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays uh uh my hubby does not have uh too much control when it comes to using that card uh laughter i know uh uh for quite a while we was using them to uh uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent oh goodness you know it uh when we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was  paying the rent plus trying plus trying to get the money for another car another car and it gets rough it got it got real rough thats hard he just popped out that uh Master Card and get that cash advance uhhuh yeah we got a big cash advance and really thats whats uh holding us back now thats yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do theyre worth it oh well i i think weve pretty much come to an end here yeah im trying to find out how long were supposed talk i think it was at least five minutes wasnt it thats what im looking for now thats why i was just trying talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing ,credit_card,2023
 hello hey how you doing not bad not bad Whats your name Fernando my name is Nick wait let me turn off my stereo here because ive been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah man am i right what time is it over there are you are you in Dallas no no im in Detroit or not Detroit im in uh California are you yeah i because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas yeah im in North Carolina oh well youre on the uh lets see on the other coast laughter yeah twenty one yeah shoot man its what midnight almost what yeah yeah its uh im watching Saturday Night Live here laughteryeah okay all right well i guess were supposed to talk what about credit card what wait what what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and what what are you working on a a Masters in uh information systems really im doing my Masters in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering yeah where at at North Carolina State University hey how do you like it out there uh i dont because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i im in Raleigh and vocalizednoise Raleigh Durham yeah yeah that area and its really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill yeah so it its basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they dont have a whole lot there where are you at uh well im in Monterey California right now oh okay so so i mean its like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and thats about it two hundred fifty okay it its its a lot bigger than Monterey is but were just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco oh okay and its only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley no no i go to the its the Naval Postgraduate school out here oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley and theyre asking like for a um vocalizednoise GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like theyre looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and its like well thats what they look for whether or not they get it its hard to say  yeah i know thats why thats why i didnt apply i mean it was like for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part yeah its pretty tough its pretty tough i mean uh lets face it you know and you know are you vocalizednoise did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know its what you do you know so uh i dont lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that so are are you going to go for your doctorate probably not see im in the Navy and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably wont do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy when do you get out oh probably be another twelve years oh okay laughter oh you know i like what im doing right now but uh but what if they pay for it  what if they pay for excuse me if they pay for a PhD nah they wont pay for it theyve i think they have maybe two people a year go vocalizednoise get their PhD because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um yeah they civilians or uh military i think i think theyre military but i mean the guy is still in and um he uh he works over in Maryland and so hes doing his Masters here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and hes doing it in like in a year and a summer and so hes getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that thats why you want to join but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once youve get your your you know Masters they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so well a lot of times its you know a lot of times its not the money that keeps people that keeps people you know they they like what theyre doing they you know they feel good about what theyre doing that type of thing its more but i mean i mean you the once you get your Masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year     oh easily im sure and thats not what theyre paying no well it depends on what rank you are of course yeah yeah laughteri laughterknow well i mean like i say if youre if youre you know if youre at an upper level in the rank category you know youre probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year but thats uh yeah those are few and far between though its uh its like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points and uh everyones a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money yeah i imagine its really competitive you know its like no i i mean IBM is like theres a joke about IBM which says you know its like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right and so IBM says well we have to we have to have a team right and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right so he goes have you come up with a solution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower laughter you know its like everyones a manager but you know its like only use like one person does the work so too many chiefs and not enough Indians yeah so yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down yeah that well thats the way it works i mean thats thats why theyre having problems i mean everyones a manager and i didnt realize that yeah i mean its like its like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know its like its like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank yeah push paper around you know like all these people are just standing sitting sitting sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go whats that this track which its going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time and so its like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff oh yeah theyve got a theyve got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you you you probably wont get fired for getting IBM material wheres if you try something different and it fails and youre dead theyll theyll say yeah why didnt you buy why didnt you try something more mainline yeah well IBM doesnt fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job which you you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit i mean thats their policy they never fire anybody unless youre caught doing something illegally illegal illegal or something like that yeah yeah like if youre stealing something or doing anything like that but they wont let you off what theyll do is like suppose you know like youre a manager so theyll put you into keeping up the paper you know its like how much paper is going in and then you say thats not my job so you quit so in other words thats the way they force people out  thats why they can say you know theres no layoff policy but it doesnt they dont really say that you know youre youre always going to have great career conditions yeah hey thats kind of sad no but i mean its like its like they they have like this different policy i dont know my dad works for them but its like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know its like they wont say well theyre the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it and so thats what youre gonna go for  yeah well you know thats thats a thats a big thing and and you know its like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge yeah they are out of Korea right leading edge dont they vocalizednoise they they made like uh small personal computers yeah small PCs arent theyre out of Korea right i dont know i i dont know but what they do is what they did i dont know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away oh yeah yeah because so is it like for example you test a chip it cant last seven years but it can last five IBM says lets throw it away Leading Edge will say well buy it from you and so thats i mean theyre still around i think  yeah ive seen well ive seen them around anyway you know vocalizednoise so thats what thats what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they vocalizednoise thats why theyre so compatible because i mean and by the time you have a computer for five years youre going to throw it away anyway most people do or they have to anyway you know vocalizednoise well i mean theres like when when you realize vocalizednoise teachers one of my teachers got this computer and which you know its like um voice uh synthesis and stuff  and he got that he said you know its like um i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory and i want more laughteryou laughterknow and its like Jesus Christ you know its like why do you want more because its like one second of recording i mean you put into a Wave and you want to correct the errors in the Wave takes so much i mean its like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by Markov model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know youre trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course its going to take a lot imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know its like laughter Jesus Christ thats amazing yeah well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory theyre gonna require yeah yeah yeah both vocalizednoise both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk memory disk base well like they say like nobody can get enough you know its like once you have something and its like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right well yeah you find out more and they were showing this like Three D graphics Three D graphics view of like like those hologram deals what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you like a hologram  just graphics on a on a

well um with credit cards is me i i try to keep maybe just one or two i dont i dont like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just dont like them laughter laughter what are you afraid of with them what am i afraid of um i dont know if im really afraid of spending too much i just uh dont think that i need them you know i uh they are tempting at times but i i just you know sometimes i just dont like everybody knowing everything about me you know so well thats very can be very very true so and there you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so youll spend money so well thats the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and thats right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest thats right uhhuh i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right thats what i do thats what i do just a second baside Whitney easide baside i will im on the phone honey easide thats all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they i have two little ones yeah yeah so but always want some vocalizednoise um four and two and a half oh boy those are two very active laughterages yes uh yeah im im like you i i use my only use my credit card for um you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i dont want to write a check and then but i dont charge anything that i cant payoff at the end of the month uhhuh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i dont even think i know my number laughter well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you dont have to continue to write checks in order to get cash uhhuh thats right see we he couldnt do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on youre right and thats kind of silly yeah right absolutely because they figure that  thats correct laughter the idea is to use their laughtermoney yeah your defeating the purpose and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i dont want it because i right well i think thats the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted yeah its like id like to know where they determine that im such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know youve already been preapproved well it and oh absolutely preapproved thats their favorite word yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think laughter i think so youre right well its interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go uhhuh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow i didnt realize i had this much you know id spent this much money and then they cant meet the minimum monthly payments on it that much spent right well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem yeah it does because youre you know vocalizednoise youre you know youre just costing costing yourself more money because you if you cant make the monthly the minimum payment youre paying interest again so yeah thats right thats right well its been enjoyable talking with you yes its enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck byebye right well take good care take care of your little ones uhhuh byebye ,credit_card,2067
hi how are you doing uh i couldnt hear you i said how are you doing im doing fine im just uh editing a spreadsheet right now im trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work until im ninety five yeah weve been doing that too  were trying to retire in our fifties yeah this yeah this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because what im figuring out is that im going to have to put in a lot more money than what im making good luck on that one then whats that i said good luck on that one then weve got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our propertys already paid for you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits would be the uh  the availability of the health insurance and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer around inside the organization without having you know when they cut off a system and they dont just can everybody thats working on it like some companies i know of you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project so you work for TI then you cant say yep yes you do well i work for DISD and i dont know what youre talking about when you say um health insurance but Dallas doesnt pay it pays most of mine you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know my i put my kids on my policy its like two hundred dollars and its gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course its going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point and benefits you know id like to see child care paid for or or onsite child child care sometime i think that would be an excellent laughteridea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day yeah thats uh thats something i hadnt really thought about since we dont have children but i can see how it would be a real benefit those that do well we can shelter also monies that were going to pay in for child care too you know go on and pay a lump sum and as long as you pay that amount youre okay but if you paid in more than you actually used and the same thing for insurance what you predict youre going to be paying for insurance as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money youre okay but if you pay out less then you lose that money i dont like that part but you dont have to do that option if you dont want to well that can i can see where that might be important and then we got that cafeteria plan do you have that no you can uh i i dont know what youre talking about there well you lets see it shelters it shelters youre money that you pay for insurance it takes it out of your salary before taxes oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance but we call it the cafeteria plan i wonder why i said i wonder laughterwhy oh its probably what the first guy who did it called it yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of laughterit maybe so lets see what else can we do changes ill tell you what we could do we could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired because you know if you mean like for health insurance well not not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company and theyre not doing their job or theyre not capable of doing their job then we should find a a place to put them or b you know boot them out well thats easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what theyre getting paid thank you  i said thank you oh well were both school teachers im im but its hard to get rid of a teacher if theyre not good i know its almost impossible well theres two schools of thought on that you know i im looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that once you get that job with the university then youve got ten years of probation then you have tenure and they cant fire you well you know in a situation like that i dont know if thats good or bad i do know that ive had tenured professors that were just sorry and ive also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago you know for in the public schools but in addition it made you ease more at ease you know you knew you werent going to lose your laughterjob unless you really did something horrendous well they they really cant fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the governments taken care of that but uh what im looking at is you know there are a lot of teachers out there that arent getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that arent worth having around as janitors  right you know and i could see a point protecting someones position but on the other hand i dont think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all well they dont in some places they dont in some places they dont but you know you youve got specialized education now do they for instance take computer science you know weve got kids twenty years old right now that could beat any computer professor at microcomputer applications i know we do and these people cant even get jobs doing anything vocalizednoise besides digging ditches because theres no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to step to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college you know you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know its nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i laughtermean yeah laughter i mean my agree is absolutely worthless its my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards what did you get your degree in Industrial Marketing and whats your job now well actually im selling computer software but the two are mutually exclusive because the its experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college not my degree which is i think kind of bizzaro all right what else could we change  oh id like to see flexible hours and teaching you know shared job sharing well lets more of that weve already weve already got that well see weve got a little bit of it but not much and itd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing what else id like to be able to to evaluate your boss and it really carry some weight and you get to choose your boss well yeah supervisor evaluations always been a tough one especially in my line because you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check well so you get to evaluate him though why not well not really you know i mean it theres what whats to evaluevaluate evaluate him on you know i mean uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero i run the whole show and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what im doing you know and uh that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation because so often you know you get a guy whos got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak you know its its hard for me to you you know especially since im in marketing sales you know i make more than my boss  because hes salary and im not i make as much as i earn you know if i dont make a sale i dont make anything yeah well its a little tough but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who arent doing a damn thing theyre just there you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they arent working not that they arent trying or anything its just that their jobs are useless you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for Ed Swampers Swampers a guy whos in the union hes a laborer and hes assigned to ,job_benefits,2085
well the thing is is that uh since im in school i dont like basically have a monthly budget because im living off my dad but the thing is is that um i have to keep it under control because for example you know its like vocalizednoise the the beginning of the semester when you go have to pay for everything everythings pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever you know its like once the semester start im the one who has to control how much spending there is and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food and uh so what about tuition and rent who takes care of that well the thing is is that i live in a dorm so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts and the the tuition is also the same thing so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and thats about it but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because its like i cant go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week no cant do that very often so i mean its for for us you know its like i i can spend i can spend that money but its not its not what i want to spend it on you know are are are you working anywhere while youre going to school no because um they dont allow me to work since uh im a foreign student oh okay and so they the government doesnt allow me to work yeah so all the money comes from home so you got to make uh so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending well the thing is is that um i basically i basically know how much i have right and so the thing is is that i i can tell like uh i get all my money out of the teller and besides see one one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international where do you call to Argentina yeah Argentina wow and so the basic one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills yeah talk too long well thats they want they want me to call down there every so often i mean i told my dad listen dad listen if you want to save money i wont call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so it doesnt matter about the money because we need to hear from you yeah so you call him collect no because its more expensive that way uh any any uh basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of i would suspect so and uh because its considered luxury in other countries oh okay so you just call him direct and then right since its his money anyway you know yeah so that and he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him no uh i got money to pay that too so its basically you know its like its not too much money and its not too little money so i wont have to you know rush a letter to him or something because uh he really wants me to concentrate on my studies yeah what are you studying what are you studying im doing masters in computer science and computer engineering and what do you think youll do with that with those degrees well i can i can work up uh here up to a year and i mean and hopefully get a job after that you want to get into some kind of manufacturing or or whats the specialty that youre looking for uh computer communications and data transmissions oh okay so you want to find a uh data transmissions youre looking for uh long distance type stuff yeah you know anywhere from uh local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that and and so well you have a family right yeah i have uh wife and two children and uh and and does does your wife work no she doesnt work she does uh well its kind of hard to say now days uh other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself and she gets paid for that so she brings some money in oh okay shes trying to start her her own business where she does that full time uh alterations and sewing and stuff for the public and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town and so and you have a monthly budget well sort sort of were probably like most American laughterAmerican laughterfamilies i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much weve got at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget so so you dont have any problem in uh overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that oh sure were like everybody else you know you weve got a uh several credit cards that sometimes uh instead of paying them all off at every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time you know thats when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff yeah yeah well then uh see uh thats thats one of the points which i dont see like i i dont give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i dont want i dont like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know its like if i want something ill ill ask somebody you know like like my uh for Christmas for Christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want and i said i want a backpack you know uh no i told him you if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack yeah but something that you can use right because i i needed a backpack so he gave me a backpack and i i knew he needed an alarm clock so i bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that that thats very uh utilitarian you know right but you make those things there are no no frivolous gifts right but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down Argentina it was to me was ridiculous because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you dont care about you know its like thats true why bother yeah yeah and so but the thing is is that um well especially being a college student you your i dont know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time its the end of the semester youve got finals and youve got lots of bills i would suspect yeah yeah what about when you have breaks like uh Christmas or between sessions well for example we had spring break now and i went skiing and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars or i expect so so uh but you know its like uh youve got to budget that though youve got to save up in able to do that right yeah yeah because its like you know say you know its like were saying lets go eat out before spring break i go lets not go eat out before spring break lets see how much money we have afterwards i mean hm laughterhm laughteryeah right right and if i felt like i spent way too much then uh i wont go out you know and so like my roommate went home i went skiing in uh over the Carolina Mountains which arent anything but um but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it you know it was a nice place sure it is any time you can get away and and get away from from the daily grind yeah yeah yeah especially if you live on campus and you dont have a car you just go crazy yeah i know the feeling so oh well lets see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half okay yeah is that okay all right all right well nice talking to you all right byebye nice talking to you have a good time bye ,family_finance,2092
all right uh what kind of um besides your besides your salary whats whats the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit well i guess uh i i im kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because im selfemployed have you ever worked for a large organization but yes i have worked ive worked for TI and ive worked for LTV oh okay uh and i suppose that uh so far as benefits are concerned the most important to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits at at this point in my life though im im im a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh in you know in my younger days i i was interested in whats the vacation policy and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on uh you know on where you are in life as to whats most important yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once and uh yeah uh you know if youre not uh if you havent havent looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire when you get to the point where youre looking forward to it then it gets to be important because youve got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you yeah thats true thats true and uh there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that dont you know that dont have good retirement plans i guess uh the companies that participate in the K type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan and uh maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that thats those are good programs uh i i im a CPA so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line and uh i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees so that they can pick and chose what they like uh you know there theyve got one that they call a cafeteria plan i dont know whether youre familiar with that or not no what is that and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where the company makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them um no i hadnt heard of that so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan thats important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan thats important to them and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one is that something that you should change from year to year uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically uh as to you know as to to get the stuff thats more important to you yeah thats uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the IRS regulations as uh as that sounds like it might be a really good idea uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans and uh i i think there you know its a pretty good option to have of course the K K is is a good you know its a good savings vehicle so uh anyway uh what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before  i think of uh you mean as far as retirement well as so far as benefit packages indicate in total i think the the most important thing for me right now is is really the medical coverage i am in uh in uh involved in a four K but im uh contributing such a such a small amount right now just to go ahead and have the account open because uh i just lets see ive been with this company for about three months and before that uh we were were were still in the process of trying to catch up yeah i understand that yeah we were we were way behind financially and so havent really uh quite managed to catch up yet yeah so exactly and were also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further right yeah its and its uh it its uh uh a hassle trying to to uh uh put your money all in the right in the savings you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it you know to get everything do you have children and so so they i guess the uh no that would complicate things even more laughter yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if youre of child bearing age then its important too you know because yeah thats probably you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child uhhuh yeah thats true and uh you want to have that coverage so anyway uh but what else well theres lets see what other yeah uh i guess uh what what kind of typical vacation programs uh vacation plans do do the companies have that youve worked for uh so far as when you get vacation and how much it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months yeah its i have not uh i have not seen vacation policies you know written in about seven years so im not real sure how theyre how theyre changing what theyre doing now most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two yeah but uh yeah thats a good deal so it work it would work either way yeah how what do you what do you find that that theyre uh when they change from two weeks to three weeks is it five years or ten years or probably five years i think yeah uh or seven uh thats kind of far away  so thats uh thats a thats a bit of a a wait to get i know that uh in the past ive worked for companies you know where they they had a pretty good uh pretty good plan uh vacation policy you know you got you got the two weeks  the first year and then they went up okay um ive got another call coming in oh is that yours okay well and its been nice talking to you okay all right bye bye okay thanks ,job_benefits,2129
okay i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute laughter well credit cards boy thats an easy topic isnt it laughter is it yes it is laughter its one we all hold dear and near im sure oh yes yes i guess ive had some good experience and some bad experience with them yeah most of mines been pretty good although im i guess im like a lot of other people now im trying to to pay off my credit cards and ive done pretty good at it well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want laughter you now not need want laughter uhhuh there is a big difference theres a big difference there yeah yeah but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them ive been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas its too easy to to run into the gas station oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least thats for me yeah what you yeah yeah but yeah ive ive talked to some whos really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i havent yet not bad you know i just im just shocked at the end of the month yeah well to see what damage i have did but yeah yeah i try to keep it pretty reasonable well ive been pretty lucky in that respect i dont charge like i say ive i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies so but i havent really had any bad problems with credit cards theres you know they have uh wonderful features theyre there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest its like paying laughtertwice yeah they talk talks with vocalizednoise thats true thats true so but i try to i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest oh uhhuh yeah compared to some of the other ones and you dont have an annual fee there and that helps oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now were just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in yeah thats one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well ill just pay on it this month and laughter pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time takes a long time thats right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax thats you know it sure does of course its been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so but yeah yeah well ive enjoyed talking to you well ive enjoyed talking to you and maybe well get to talk again okay byebye ,credit_card,2163
 okay all right uh feelings on what caused the S and L  i guess i dont have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where loan were made that appear to be a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued umhum kind of like a dominos effect right i i dont have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever no no uh i vaguely recall but ive never gone and and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i dont have a real since of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour umhum no i dont think it was really corruption that caused it or within i think people just started you know not not being as careful with the loans that they were making you you know whenever they gave them out i think maybe they didnt check into them enough or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed its sort of well no skin of my back ill move on to this other company or umhum umhum i i just since that they didnt have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i dont know whether thats because they had other opportunities to which they could move umhum  you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didnt werent stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on  im not sure or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didnt they didnt care any more i i just im rather puzzled about the whole thing laughter umhum i know well laughter im um i know a little bit about it but i dont as much as i should know about it im a finance major here at Clarion and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think thats kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it well they didnt they didnt have a since of risk no i dont think so oh okay and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know theyre limited to the types of loans that theyre allowed to make and i think the S and Ls were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i dont think this would have happened well do you think we theres a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and nickels but do you think theres accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is or is there more to be heard yet  i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it laughterwasnt making it wasnt as good news as it was i think its still adding you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile so you dont think necessarily they dont have a complete grasp yet of the problem or whether it vocalizednoise no i dont i dont think they do i dont think how i dont think how they could find that big vocalizednoise you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and Ls still open and its and its very possible for them to go down in the future because of this to be caught in the land slide do you think to possibly is that itll happen with the the regular banks i i dont know i think i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it it seems that i recall reading for the last oh lets say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans i have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost  oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just reading i think it was in Venezuela i cant remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back you know and they just they just wrote it right off i think i think weve lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back its impossible to get it back and so you think that its just gone umhum yeah because were were you know were talking about some companies that have just like even gave up on getting it back theyre even trying any more they just totally wrote it off their book do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors which i dont think is what it was meant to do so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exists for for these sorts of of problems umhum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing um it its just its just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um yeah vocalizednoise as long as theres enough little companies were going to have to have something so your since is that the that uh the the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money and given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected and that is its million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of of dollars being protected it it seems like um  there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts uh its if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion billion dollars and were taking about monies way in access of that now so its obvious that weve protected large accounts and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought  yeah you know that the for i guess im content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes its on an individual basis someone whose got accounts in thirty five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars and theyre all protected by the government seems to me like theyve gotten around what was laughter intended to be the issue there i guess i dont have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and Ls and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means means im not worried enough i think it could happen yeah uh its kind of thing where maybe well survive and then i then it will happen again because we dont pay attention to those kinds of things i think itll happen again but i think itll be a long time in the future before it does happen again because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future but i think later on theyre gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean youre gonna have to take some risks and as long as theyre backed i think theyre still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it vocalizednoise possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future well perhaps if there are regulatory constraints put back in place it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation uh vocalizednoise ,bank_bailout,2228
 well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago my husband was raised here but i i have never lived here so um when when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasnt a state income tax and there wasnt a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so  im sort of feeling like were getting a better laughterdeal here than what i was accustomed to yeah well did you move from the the Northeast well i lived in Missouri and then in Utah and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax and um weve always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store so i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries groceries and  but i think i mean i i dont enjoy paying taxes and its hard but um i think thats what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and  excuse me and have and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess what i feel is that most people um they dont like to pay taxes because they feel like well theres some people who arent paying their fair share yeah i think yeah its the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to laughter  and um that makes you feel bad right and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know i i didnt have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um it was kind of hard for me to think heres someone who as wealthy as he is didnt have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed  he had didnt have to pay income tax and he thought well you know theres some people are living pretty pretty good life styles but theyre not paying income tax and thats not fair to me and theres you know some people who uh are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um im willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries ive studied and visited and um im willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i dont think theres probably any really put that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed you know i guess in Texas with uh we live here also and that its mostly sales tax so its really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because theyre paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff ive lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year were there it was like eight hundred dollars and were like oh no laughter you know what laughterhappened laughteris my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas and now laughter you know so i mean that was kind of different and then to file a laughter uhhuh a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since weve been married weve moved a lot and so it always seems like you know were always paying in taxes for something and so the it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back but i um have accounting background so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked  for accounting firm and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places  they dont have to pay taxes or to buy something that loses money so that they can you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if i can understand maybe why the rich people dont want to pay you know a large large percent because it you know thats not really fair either if theyve earned their money by themselves well you know people  just kind of given the laughtermoney its kind of depressing sometimes i think well it is and um and sometimes i think um well for myself that the income that we have were paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind thisll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think were you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way were compensated um just by our society yet you know they dont pay you um what just what it would take and then if if you pay taxes on it you wouldnt have any money left over and  and um but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would laughteri guess because im not one of them laughter i wish that they would um you know realize that they well yeah thats laughtertrue they couldnt make this kind of money they couldnt live that kind of life style anywhere else in that even if they made that kind of money theres some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they wouldnt be able to enjoy the uproots that and that so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it yes theyve earned it and yes theyve thats great theyve you know had such great fortune here but they need to pay for it too because they couldnt do that somewhere else um um i like Texas um not having the state income tax and i hope that because um you know that weve had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we dont laughter the industry here is able to to um fund the state because we have oil here and things i mean thats what ive always heard is that um but they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really hasnt been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes i wouldnt think big boom  yeah theres something about um the industry in the state that um theres enough i know we moved here from Houston and um the city had its enough money it was really nice that they had uh but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would have have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community country club type things that the it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city and i really liked that dont you have to why people just kind of debate expect certain services then then they dont really think they should pay for them or something maybe i dont know yeah its true and im you know like the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri but um im im comfortable at least this year with we pay we have some good schools you know the school thing might be changing but im im willing to pay for that for my children and im willing to sacrifice i guess i mean im not going to be the kind of person thats going to grumble about the taxes even though were paying pretty high percentage um i feel like you get what you pay for and i want to be here and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country and having seen other countries id much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and and not anyway well laughter laughteri guess i better let you go laughter well it was nice talking to you i havent ever i need to ive never initiated one of these phone calls do you call in do you get to pick the subject or do they kind of yeah it was nice talking no no they just define it to you and so so you get what get uh luck of the draw but laughter yeah laughter anyway well good luck to you byebye  oh i see okay you too bye ,taxes,2234
okay you wanna start um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back if you cant pay for it you shouldnt have it period that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans thats just uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something master charge i dont have a master charge thank you laughter but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing right but thats the problem see as our system shouldnt be based on owing and borrowing and all that uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldnt be able to own automobiles or they wouldnt be able to own a house yes they would they just wouldnt be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i were twenty eight if we lived our lives and didnt become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldnt be destitute i mean we wouldnt be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it i would be so good it would be so much better it wouldnt be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent im just taking the other side just so well have a discussion uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it i didnt need it i shouldnt have even qualified to get it i didnt need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it and as i look back now now were paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but dont take out ten thousand dollars in loans dont do it and i dont i hope dont think hell have to do that but i just so like we might if we didnt have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because Gods really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy including new vans and so so i guess ive seen it done and i know you can do it you know but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van and thats where Americans dont like to do it and so and we dont want to cut back our services from the government because were spoiled well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget very simple just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like Columbus Day Presidents Day i mean they get they get all these days off now give them i know laughter what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year i know and thats about uh three or four less than civil servants get now just look at that money the government could save if they didnt have all of those days off all those holidays yeah that is true because i always think the mail never comes on these days and youre like well what is it laughter you dont even know its a holiday laughter well now dont forget the mail is something else again that has nothing theyre not civil servant people but isnt that federal in the federal budget no no they have their own budget they go by but isnt it part of our income its not part of our taxes no you know thats why vocalizednoise the price of mailing a letter keeps going up its not thats why it keeps laughtergoing laughterup huh thats another topic you know i could i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter those stamps are valuable now yeah laughter they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail thats funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that that overall though i just think were just going to i dont know see i know i guess im kind of leery of this topic because i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to be a potential power problem later with um whos going to be in charge with this new world order and i you know im uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money system we already have new bills printed for vocalizednoise US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean ive seen them laughter and so i know that the longterm vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh but im concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know thats a lot of power for one or two people to have and so um i guess because i i guess i feel like i know what their longterm vision is im kind of like you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i dont think Americans are willing to do it well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments how do you feel about that i dont i dont feel we should loan them money if i i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i dont feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesnt work are they gonna well in so many cases its not a loan its just a give a giveaway but its not but its not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because were our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back it be do you understand its i guess its a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but because theres no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because were loaning it i think thats the problem and i dont mean give it to everybody that asks use a lot of discernment dont give money to every nation you know what im saying i think were loaning money to too many nations but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think were never going to get that back you know do you understand no that thats true i i understand that France still owes us money from World War I and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off and said well well cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them right long what long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you cant alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially thats my opinion my opinions the latter uhhuh well uh ive got to respect your opinion you have some uh solid ideas i know but whats yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term well i dont believe in a single government or a single control for the world uh thats asking for trouble people are too different i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run so therefore i dont believe there could be a single government for the whole world theres too many societies involved uh the language barriers uh oh sure they somebody said years ago well lets make it English uh an international uh language thats a big laugh we cant even make English a a national language here in our country weve got too many uh uh uh immigrants yeah um they dont call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddys day yeah different ethnic groups laughter a vocalizednoise well yes yeah but uh yeah i know what youre saying my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century and uh as a matter of fact hes a draft dodger he uh was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you ,budget,2235
what kind of coins do you primarily collect um basically i my preference is Arab and ancient coins hum ive got a uh ive got a few i dont know i dont know i dont even know if theyre real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box im mostly into uh American gold and silver dollars and stuff like that oh very interesting um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so ive got a few of those tucked away but um your Greek and Roman coins might you know if if theyre um in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them out and i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well ill take them with me and let somebody look at them they just they just feel phony you know they feel like theyre made of lead or something and uh they dont have any sort of its its got a its got a like a picture on it but theres no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else that would be the Greek ones okay because i think most the Roman ones have had something on them right right so this yeah it had a it had a had a has a bust of somebody on there but uh no sort of identifying marks or anything um it the are they silver or no i dont no theyre not theyre its its too heavy for silver its its more like lead i think fairly soft oh interesting yeah i think theyre fakes laughter did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily probably laughter i dont know where they got them from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things its probably about thirty or forty of them in there gee thats yeah they laughter you might be sitting on a gold mine wouldnt that be something right um i dont know a lot about um Greek and Roman although im a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so ive picked up a bit but um if it if theyre really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them Lydian coins and um gosh all these years ive been thinking they were fakes maybe theyre real laughter right i dont uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes you know if you go to um uh a fight and then the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night umhum laughter but um i think thats fairly recent phenomena probably sounds like some of the coin dealers i know now now laughter theyre supposed to theyre supposed to be licensed and the um above board right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you laughterknow oh i see laughter oh and you made your own yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them last night laughter heres a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year laughter was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold yeah that they they are gold theyre just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value and amazingly enough youre youre into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon oh really is that uh still still true yeah still is yeah thats sort of like a cottage industry industry over there uh and and theres some very specific things you can find you can even narrow narrow it down to where it was made i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one and uh you you can almost tell the area somebody probably even knows the guy who made them you mean make i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody cant say you know when hes selling them that somebody else made it i mean its so that he gets his own profits yeah well the  yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them sell these things and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit laughter and thats always very difficult oh i see otherwise the the buyer is responsible i mean responsible well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if its an unscrupulous dealer hell just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know its yours course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but youd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldnt fraud is very difficult to prove umhum umhum because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it and thats all hes got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin so you know its his word against mine right right thats one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on oh thats interesting because im more interested in the research and im doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the six and seven hundreds and so and so im not into the the buying and selling business um it sounds like im wise laughter laughter yes yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh grading systems have changed over the last few years thats primarily what got me out of it they they kept changing the grading systems on coins and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection and youve graded it at the current grade and then the next year theyve changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them you know its just it it just got it just got ludicrous after a while umhum umhum what what what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them as M S sixty five then by golly theyre M S sixty five i dont care what you say umhum umhum and theyll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them at inflated laughterprices umhum i think thats thats the the hardest thing is that people who dont really know feel sometimes a sometimes for example i know um you know the ancients better but because its old they figure its got to cost you know thousands of dollars oh yeah yeah i mean its really its it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um Indian head pennies you know and they say wow you know this is really old yeah well its not worth anything laughter laughter ill give you a nickel for it laughteryou laughterknow and even even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces right right and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars oh really i didnt know that oh yeah yeah theyre cheap theyre super cheap oh that several i mean its its it its funny the way the business works because therere so many things that are enormously out priced some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them are are worth hundreds of dollars you know and and the coins themselves arent worth very much at all face value basically and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and its traded for silver so basically if if someone isnt really interested in the coins its not some an investment no its its more of a uh its a commodity purchase really uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do find some some uh nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books can fill a whole bunch of them with these uh with these bags uh especially you you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um id give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced um but i used to go through i id get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh about about twelve bags of these things and id gone through all of them and i found a couple of them i found a nineteen O nine VDB and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce i found several good ones out of there peoples giving it to me for two cents i uh thats okay turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars laughter ,family_finance,2243
so what kind of benefits do do you have in your job that you think is uh very important health care health care like dental number one dental and medical yes yes im fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance so i was really fortunate i really was so just this so you think that the uh a good company will provide good health i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know its just going completely out of sight i hear thats like one of the major uh the major costs to companies to corporations nowadays it is very much so its a billion dollar problem you know every year uh our company had it doesnt apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that theyre having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the copayments are going up and im concerned thats just you know the beginning of it see the problem i have with it is that i dont have a job oh yeah so i dont have laughter and im still in in school im still in college thats a problem too yeah umhum right and so i dont i dont know firsthand of these benefits umhum right but i i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i dont know about dental i mean oh i dental is is kind of like uh you know youre asking for uh too much to for me i think its like uh you know uh youre youre expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and theyll pay you for it but to actually have you know big coverage for something like that umhum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know its its good its certainly better than nothing its not you know its not super you for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably dont have it you know i do have some dental problems and its very very expensive right im only twenty one and if your blessed with you know good dental uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are ive had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up you know we didnt know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then laughterexactly yeah so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them as health right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible oh gosh thats thats the general you know you you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately i have two children and theyre both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i dont i dont have medical you know expenses for them per say uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage uhhuh i guess it also depends on how many how many times youre going to use it now we thats right thats right and also we i say we uh im retired from Texas Instruments and theyre just theyre like most everybody else you cant just you dont drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but theres only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go but theres only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesnt make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go right so also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective too expensive more expensive for them to do that then right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really theres a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it umhum so that thats pretty good and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldnt have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself umhum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that theyre going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy absolutely you need about even probably the very first thing i i should look at huh absolutely do you have a family no not yet i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do but i would really check that out because im concerned in coming years its going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks what im really scared about and you know im i dont know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger umhum right and thats scary because you know in the end youre getting insurance for basically nothing thats right i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance laughter yeah absolutely absolutely um you know some companies cant cant even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance theyre just dropping it you know they dont have any choice its bankrupting them but im i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with with health benefits that sounds like a big big asset to do that oh absolutely absolutely same to you vocalizednoise well its been nice talking to you i guess ill uh maybe see you again sometime okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you byebye you too bye ,job_benefits,2250
 okay lets see i think uh i guess since i call im supposed to start i think thats the way everybody has done it so far but anyway i i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money um were probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i dont think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a a couple of weeks because theyve been messing it up for many years now so yeah well i have to agree that laughter and and youre right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think theyre mismanaged and i think that sometimes its too easy of a i dont know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say ill tax them if you cant get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending um i dont know what yall are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know were paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation right i think its seven here or seven point something yeah ours is seven point seven five laughteralmost eight and it drives me crazy im thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about  laughter yeah we dont want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they dont do anything about it umhum  right do where are you at what state  im in Lubbock Texas yeah oh really yeah theres were still we still one of few that dont have the uh state tax taxes thats true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay yeah thats true know you dont sound like youre from Dallas where do you come do you come from originally Texas or yeah yeah i do ive lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh its i dont know rural an urban area i guess whatever i dont know what im oh okay you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there no no ive just lived here but i dont know i i do i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i cant think of this the scripture Render unto Caesars what is Caesars so thats right you know even uh i think even in the the story where uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fishs mouth or in the fishs inside the fish and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the vocalizednoise would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself and so thats what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course thats when he said well you know you render unto Caesars what is Caesars you render unto God what is Gods and uh and you know of course there i dont think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something laughter right get in yeah but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i dont want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that theyre necessary you know so i really do oh sure umhum right where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or yeah are no not really i i weve i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year um i have been married for just a few years so ive had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular laughterright all the deductions and all that schedule A well yeah and you know did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder laughter yeah it really did i i saw that too i didnt notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and laughter other things right right thats were looking at buying a house and thats one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and its the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year youve paid all interest and no principles so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back yeah yeah you know theres a a thing i just ive been trying to learn as much as i can about it if if you pay i i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months thats right so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month youll come out paying a uh one month extra every year and itll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note thats right thats right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and thats exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said its going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that oh yeah right yeah uh just because uh exactly what you said youre making one more months payment every year right and thats going on the principle it doesnt pay any interest or usually usually it doesnt anyway yeah so thats thats a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner right thats what were looking at fifteen or maybe twenty were not going to go longer than twenty but were taking our time were going uh try to make our decision by July well thats good though so and we just started like two or three weeks ago and were not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most well thats good though is it kind of a buyers market down there youll be uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so thats well thats good thats laughterpretty excellent i dont know we couldnt think of a better time to buy than now thats good but anyway well um i cant think of a whole lot more to say well i cant either i appreciate the call though yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife vocalizednoise uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married i enjoyed talking to you in Lubbock i guess before i even met her but  baside Breyiana Breyiana look at me please easide just a second baside be quite please i can not hear i will talk to you in just a second easide go ahead so she went to school out here but anyway i just yeah she went to school there at uh Cathy Walker what was her name no i didnt know any Walkers no yeah but she well good luck in your house hunting yeah thanks a lot you yall work at TI you you do okay oh really wow thats interesting i work in the wafer in the wafer fabrication in i do yeah im in human resources yeah do you really

Resources the last two years and i work with those same people that i worked with all those nine years so i feel kind of part of the staff laughter  yeah yeah im im uh turning in a capital request

kind of thing he he he had a lot of good results yeah thats thats what he said here hes gotten us into a linear flow that weve never been in before well good and thats thats vocalizednoise been a real big plus and hes broadened our um the devices that were making too oh okay which has made us as lot more stable but anyway well it was nice to talk to you and theyre are going to interrupt us any minute now i can tell well thats good well you too and well i know they will and besides that my daughter wants me to put her to bed so laughter well have a good day byebye  okay yeah me too you well you too bye ,taxes,2260
first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments now dealing on the federal level two percent two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because theyre actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product or their or their gross national product or profit okay profit rather im not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what youre saying if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent if their gross national profit say a million dollars then pay five five percent of that seems fair to me laughter also individual level but the um overall it just seem like theyve modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is its definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people middle class and you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden well i am awfully bored with uh every every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft and so much misspending that that money doesnt necessarily go where its supposed to go uh i know you dont ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the welfare dollar needs to come back to to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesnt need that money when its directed from afar i think the chance for misspending is greater i i suppose im thinking more in terms i im not thinking in terms of increasing taxes im just thinking for a quick fix uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts thats never going to happen i know laughter thats well maybe thats what im saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though the one thing that i had thought about to help correct that problem youve got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington thats all they have ever done after theyve been there that long theyre so deep rooted with their the old boy network i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then theyve got to sit out one i think thats wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician i dont think we should ever give them a lifetime income but we do dont we laughteryes i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous theres they have locked their benefits in to the point that once theyve served two terms theyre on gravy train anyway yes i think youre right i dont think we should ever give them a lifetime thing and theyre the ones that have screamed so much much much about that dont want to increase taxes and they dont want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise it they dont they speak with fork and tongue dont laughterthey at least were in agreement on that arent we laughter im afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and im not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow i think eventually its going get to the point where theres going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what its finally come to were you getting so far down to where youre being taxed so far down where you cant even afford to change your mind its going to come to a point where the average American citizens say weve had enough how do they react then were prosecuted if we simply dont pay our taxes so im not real sure how you believe then that eventually therell be an overthrow we know communism doesnt work what do we do next well in the form of capitalism that weve got apparently thats not working real good either uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority saying speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess im saying were all selfish maybe not a case of everybody being selfish every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody elses yes thats true it doesnt seem to workout that way laughterthough laughterdoes laughterit i think that the lobbyist uh are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesnt seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe thats why corporate America gets away with what theyre doing because of the kickbacks and et cetera im a bit of a a pessimist i dont see a change in my lifetime im afraid youre younger perhaps you can foresee one i never put anything beyond as far as when itll happen that im not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt yes i think youre right im just saying that i dont think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system uh with the elected officials i im not sure that uh its working right now though it is the best system thats out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point absolutely laughter nice talking to you okay nice talking to you bye ,budget,2261
anyway uh do you work for a large corporation corporation well i did uh and im currently uh consulting now so im with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are pretty basic uh medical um i dont get any profit sharing and stuff like that so i uh i work with a medium size company and we dont have profit sharing but vocalizednoise i would enjoy it since we uh its a service based organization so it would be nice but yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh is they are now offering you know flex flexible benefits where you have more control and allocate uh like you can uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can can do other things and uh that would be nice they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits so it sounds like theyre going to get very more flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no ive got a family two children yeah are you single okay uh alright do you have children are you single no i im uh single im uh never been married so you are i no i said ive never been married im only im only twenty six so oh you never have oh yeah thats laughtertheres laughterstill laughtera laughterlot laughterof laughtertime laughterfor laughterthat i had already been married and had one child by that time but um i still got a few years laughter we uh weve we just kind of started young in life laughter but uh uh we uh my husbands still with the same company for ten years and as a result it has worked out so hes got a real nice benefit package but um its uh its nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess so what are the most important benefits to you oh the hospitalization um is vocalizednoise the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because its a good well rounded program its you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductibles reasonable i think its three fifty a year for the family whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductibles i think five hundred a year and it costs a lot more im with a smaller company though the but the medical stuff itself uh the health plan youre with it only it only covers fifty percent thats right thats the worst ive ever heard yeah its not very good its usually the eighty basic eighty twenty besides your initial deductible thats what varies the most i guess uh yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month ha um and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah copayments thats what they are yeah copayments type stuff well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or its the most important uh coverage uh of the you know you may not even go in to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you you know to get covered is important well if we uh one of our children is just is just turned two and her first eighteen months of life laughterGod well she had one operation shes been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean laughtershes shes just expensive the other one wasnt nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents laughter uhhuh how about any matching programs you ever you know what i mean where they contribute contribute contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a K no  oh yeah yeah my husbands got that available thats great is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent  i think its fifty percent up to four percent or maybe its fifty percent up to eighty percent im not exactly sure but that thats a nice i think thats an important benefit yeah thats great uh i dont get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i didnt make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave laughter yeah uh it its nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is but uh money that you can touch but its tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CDs and gets life its a its a term life policy also with an annuity yeah yeah yeah thats what it is you know about insurance laughter i didnt know anything about insurance until i had got laughteruntil laughteri laughterhad laughterchildren i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is when i was in school still i was down in Florida working and uh during during the summer some how i got a hold of involved in a a marketing organization that marketed uh replacing those uh whole life policies which arent very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh they would uh you know analyze it the persons current policy and get a computerized computerized you know statement of uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life was you know theres fairly big discrepancies discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but uh so i know a little about uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but you know i dont know what i get out maybe twenty thousands or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh im not worried about that i dont have anybody to to until you get your dependents it just doesnt matter yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you dont want to be a burden to anybody else uh yeah right and uh but as far as being able to really leave anything so i think yeah i mean im not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount uh and you know thats fine but uh uh you know to get that coverage and know that ill get you know you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i havent made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh are your family see ive ive kind of moved around from my home originally and vocalizednoise um my familys out in Florida now most of my family and im out here in Phoenix so but uh anyway as far as benefits um what else is important important uh obviously i think uh a profit sharing is is uh is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term ive never my husbands company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesnt and id really like it if my company did laughter they turn quite a profit at times but its not part of uh whats available so yeah theres the smaller the the companies its either the smaller company you you youre in to into the consulting side and theyll youll finish up a project and youll get the little bonus that type of thing um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing but um most you know most medium or small probably dont do that much profit sharing and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so laughter it didnt help any to share yeah laughter they couldnt share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but i wasnt qualified qualified for my first year something you know after so have you been have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah little over three years now at uh it uh quite a different world isnt it laughter versus being life before real world life in college versus what

well budgeting is a sore subject in this laughterfamily yeah me too i know exactly what laughteryou laughtermean laughter weve actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um vocalizednoise i think its good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we we never seem to be able to stick with it no its really hard to do that i mean its laughter i dont know i guess um we do kind of have a budget um but its kind of funny what we what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make uh do you not understand what im saying we we pay a percentage um which is kind of strange laughter a lot of people dont do laughterthat but hey we find that it works you know now im sorry what is what is this again laughter well okay um laughter like i pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the bills and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck do you understand laughter okay i guess i didnt really explain that too laughterwell oh okay oh i see oh sure yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense laughter yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um we weve got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately theres a big category called miscellaneous oh laughter that one gets used up quick is that it laughter and uh miscellaneous thats the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we figure its going to be its never what it was last month and uh and uh you know its its the one thats always the killer thats laughter um but i uh you know its uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um so so oh wow thats really that is pretty detailed so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category were paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our moneys going we dont have any control over it but we have a real good sense of where its going laughter well but you know thats good too because ive been in the situation in the past where i didnt know where my money was going and that thats hard to you know you cant keep up with it and it really gets you in trouble laughter you know and were were at a point where were trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like my wifes going back to school and im going to school and were our kid weve got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things oh yeah and uh i think i think wed be totally bankrupt if we didnt do something um and and what weve proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month is that were spending more than than we make laughter so its its kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah thats easy to do its very easy to do and its vocalizednoise i dont vocalizednoise it do you find it easier to i mean do with a budget do you feel like youre you do i mean i know you said you have better control but do you feel like youre really saving anything i mean  well no i i i think um i i i dont think were saving anything i i think what were doing is were were were making it possible to to well and the fact what it is is its making it possible to live beyond our means um vocalizednoise because oh laughter well thats you know what if we didnt track it wed wed totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um so you know we we do know that we can tell when were getting to the point where weve just got to uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says this you know we cant do this right now because the moneys just not there we we were going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it vocalizednoise you know its um we uh you know were not going to get this budget isnt going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but which is easy to do yeah uhhuh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too you know im going back to school my wifes going back to school too our lifestyle right now is meant to position ourselves so financial uh the these financial problems wont be problems uh in the future and uh so weve thats thats the were look we look it as as yeah were living like this now but its a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on right well thats good laughter i know what you mean about the school because thats what im trying to do also and were trying to build it enough so that i can go to school full time because right now im going to school part time were going were going through the exact same thing yeah laughter so you know trying to budget is again you know at at this point were trying to budget enough so we can save more um you know so i can go to school full time you know its its not easy to do but laughter i i dont know that wed ever be able to get to that point but uh but its something to work for laughter oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough itll happen laughterbecause because i can we can see it you know i think its going to be a couple of years before i can do that yeah yeah thats i think were in probably in the same position you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps right yeah yeah um and and and it also makes it possible you i think before we did any kind of budgeting we we we were in we were in a constant state of saying we cant afford anything you know we cant do anything we cant afford anything and now we can at least say well we can fit this in its it doesnt really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldnt before yeah it really makes a world of difference doesnt it it really does i know ive been in like i said the same situation you know where ive ive been in a situation where i didnt budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent laughtermoney and it doesnt work laughter it doesnt it really doesnt uh makes a big difference thats right thats right laughter it it it yeah i we i think that uh part of the uh the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that that there were those years where we lived that way and were still paying for it oh definitely laughter laughteryou laughterknow and so the only way to get out from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting yeah you dont want to especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up and theyre they want to do things like go to college uh you dont want to say well were still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and yeah well thats thats a big thats really important because i do have a college fund set aside for my kids you know and my oldest one is um almost going on nine so you know its not that many years you know laughter before shes going to be going so i hope that you know i can continue the college fund because its thats right thats right i know its important that they go to college when they get out of high laughterschool laughteryeah laughterright well you know i were were were trying to put money away for that too and uh um um you know you just cant count on them being totally brilliant though though they are but you cant count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um its you know no thats true i mean it doesnt always work that way laughter you hope you hope that they can but laughter you know you cant plan laughterright yeah thats right right laughter thats thats the way you have to do it right no laughter right or at least loans laughter that they pay off laughter yeah yeah well no thats thats an important thing to me and thats why it was very important for me because i didnt go to college out of high school it was important for me to budget in uh yeah a um college fund for them because it was just so important i said i dont want them to go through what i went through they have to have a college laughterfund so well you know the the im im also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them because uh when i grew up i had no no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um yes i know exactly laughter i was the same way so we were trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of thats supposed to go to savings for instance very good yeah and uh um yeah and they understand our eh the process our process vocalizednoise uhhuh youre thats thats thats strange because ours all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them oh yeah and all their money has to go in their savings account you know which maybe im being a little bit too harsh laughterbut but if they need something i buy it for them you know i mean if its an absolute need you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if its a need i just get it

hi Kay i uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering whats the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job well um i we just recently graduated from Rice University and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things and some of the things that were important to me my uh when my husband was looking for his job was um hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all laughter so i was you know didnt want him to have a job that laughter yeah laughter would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance for the family our family because wed like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it yeah i dont ever want to have to worry about that thats real important to me um you know we have that that Aetna um thats what we the insurance that we have right now when we were in Colorado they had um a different type of HMO there that i really liked a lot umhum us too it was um not that kind of HMOs where you have to go to their theyre sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the HMO and um you know then you only had to pay the it for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions well thats nice uhhuh thats good and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time laughter that those prescriptions can be very expensive oh i know we just went through that ourselves we just you know were like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things oh i know especially if you get what is it Seclor i think laughterthat that just about breaks the bank laughterright laughterthere umhum the yes its pretty bad well yeah and we um we were interested in having dental dental insurance too because um well having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and do you we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one we have um you know were at Aetna with uh an vocalizednoise we have like the medical the dental insurance is separate is that what you mean and i dont think its the basic i think its the other one the one thats like you get additional theyll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures we just have the basic right now and umhum uhhuh for most things it tends to cover it we dont have too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find doctors dentists that will accept  pretty much whatever the basic plan pays a couple of times weve had to pay oh i dont know three to five dollars but thats not that bad uhhuh no thats great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too yes and lets see besides insurance other things that we looked at um well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we dont like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or laughtersomething no we dont like that either laughter  so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well hes uh you know hes at the one thats at um is his office in Plano seventy five at uh six thirty five and so well by living in Plano were just about fifteen minutes away and uhhuh uhhuh oh thats not bad especially especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didnt want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting laughter oh yes youre not kidding and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when youre out driving thats right and um so that was something that was important to us and because like like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so laughterlong that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and well that those are some of the things that are very important to us too um we wed like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um i think thats thats pretty nice but i have to say that since weve come here we havent done it too much though we havent enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but thats a thats a nice benefit to have umhum thats true thats really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having having now but when when could uh your salary increase and is there was there somewhere to go laughter yeah that thats one of the i think the hard things right now i mean theyre going through some some tough times laughter to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job laughter yes that that we can make our mortgage payments and yeah thats really true uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um  guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think its often in a smaller company its a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times  smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company its hard to do that because therere just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that just one of the things that that happens when someone when youre dealing with a large company but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i cant stand these laughterpeople laughteri but uh so thats something that was important to him and right laughter thinking he could um work under those how long has he been in his present position oh just since last last summer its only been not even a year yet so well i was going to say laughter it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to have to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it in a big company though you also get moved around a laughterlot he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some laughtertime or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know laughter yes were laughteroh yeah you never know were hoping that that laughterwont be the case we i think one of the most one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um my husband was raised in Irving and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean its not that far but people would have we didnt have anyone in town that was our family and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that yeah were very so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way were very far from our families and its really hard families little children and um they were the only grandchildren and so our our families are are are really far away in fact this is laughtera laughterlittle laughteroff the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for a half an hour so i loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and laughter met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and laughter i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer laughter oh thats nice yeah and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and yeah i mean its its hard i mean to to just for us to snatch a half hour like that is is a special occasion for us so um well thats definitely the way we feel its nice its nice that you can have your family close like that were really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family laughter but its turned out really good and i think that you know were really satisfied with that choice and yeah sometimes it can be laughter we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us thats good but anyway laughter well i my children just ran out the door so i need to laughtergo laughtercheck laughteron laughterthem but ive really enjoyed this conversation conversation and and uh nice to have met you and you have a

okay you want to go first well uh topic being the banking crisis uh thats a real hot topic laughter real real mess i guess you must say yeah sure is yeah it is of course you youve youve had your fair share of that down your way too oh yeah think uh probably i guess its pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think Texas probably uh suffered and or caused the uh laughter the major or a good portion of it no argument here yeah i i think that uh now im im no financial expert but from what ive read and heard that makes two of us yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make uh riskier uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the  the major culprit um with the oil crisis well also in investments investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicted predicated on uh a certain price per barrel to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasnt any way to break even yeah i guess that was the immediate cause uh shoot i dont uh i tell you one thing as far as the way theyre handling it i uh i feel pretty strongly about this and thats i think theyre over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers yeah yeah i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum and on the other hand i dont know whether theyre doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real you know the the presidents of the banks and those people that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that didnt didnt they just uh put another another thirty billion dollar BandAid on the problem last week or something uh im not sure i didnt President approved some more money to bail them out yeah its going to be uh its uh your and my money thats doing that you know thats unfortunately well thats true of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation and uh at some point in time its either going to be repaid or just completely blown off im not sure which which one is which i i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them out of it yeah now i im a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years ive heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i dont know how many decades it didnt happen and uh i dont know what its what its going to take to turn that around thats a good point they uh they got a little uh a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully theyll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial uh lets see what were some of the other other points she mentioned topic wise uh do we think enough is being done to address it i i i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i dont i dont remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were it seems to me like they really havent uh at least they havent if theyre doing anything its still pretty much uh uh not out in the open its uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh right right panels or whatever you know committees or investigations nothing uh nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i dont think thats true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf maybe now uh that were putting that behind us that well be able to to address this in more depth does tend to uh push that out of the front page well hey its been real good talking with you yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that yeah i think uh one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh whats whats the its capacity was short that day or something whats the minimum is that like three minutes i dont think there is a i dont know if there is a minimum oh okay so im uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end i i think so too nice talking with you you bet byebye ,bank_bailout,2298
okay so do you all keep a budget no we dont you dont no i just i i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck its pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well are you being smart or are you serious im being facetious im being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh or i guess the financial planners the training now weve had it for about four years who got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing and theres some freebies out there are you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly monthly bring home in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh or a listed liquid account and which which we do um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case theres a major need for that okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm hes going to sue the pants off of you these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so you you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them are there to pacify situations and some of them are there to prevent things from happening but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old and then uh weve just been kind of working on ive been developing it but its kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know thats funny yeah we have a were twenty eight and hes been working at TI for five years and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because hed worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so were you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and its because you know we were eighteen when we had him so were were kind of looking at this from the other aspect of we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities weve had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house but we dont you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand so you know we have tradeoffs so were more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isnt real wise but we just we dont have the income at this time really to have any because we have um three debts that were trying to pay off from both of our student loans were still paying trying to pay those off and we have one car payment that were vocalizednoise i think we have about thirteen months left on it and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment um theyll pay vocalizednoise our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and itll work out perfect do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union no we dont vocalizednoise okay thing about the credit union is its the way its set up is if you have two thousand dollars left lets say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesnt all go towards principal they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know so its like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans vocalizednoise not really the best in the world but but you know theyre theyre uh since your husband is is is um uh a TIer but doesnt have the loans with the credit union theyre offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i dont know what your percent is on your on your car payments but they are theyll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car theyll take it and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think its a ten and a quarter percent oh really which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something and shes doing it i mean its not like its like does she have to pay to have it refinanced i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the TIer to be part of the credit union TIer to see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI hed uh gotten saved and stuff and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you dont have anything you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and wed look about nineteen people still think were about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us and so its just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know so we went in and they financed the car for five and we didnt know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so were kind of upset that were having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because youre paying more interest but your um payments your payments are lower you know yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher oh really and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said dont you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and wed already signed the papers and i maybe i might have been there i dont remember hearing that but i also wasnt the one in charge of it so i wasnt paying as close of attention but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time well do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what well do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that and then you save a lot if if if if and you need to be very careful if the loan is set up to have bimonthly they call it a yuppie loan if its set up for bimonthly payments if you because youll save seventeen fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan seven im sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan and there are there is a local firm thatll actually if if like in my situation i dont have that because the loan was not available i can have this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but im not interested because were moving out of the house next year oh really yeah but uh vocalizednoise those are all great the the interesting thing were getting ready to have a house built is its not a lot of the firms that offer mortgage mortgage loan firms arent offering um that loan i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but its not as open as it it should be its a great idea hell id love to cut ours in half but uh man and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment itll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i itll shave almost you know X number of dollars off vocalizednoise right yeah we real weve become aware of that we have a theres a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know and so were going to use people that were in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal laughteris going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car were not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know were going to go to somebody that we know were going to take someone with us older and we didnt do any of those things somebody you trust uh you know there are so many ripoff artists here in this town its its and its uh its really a sin it really is i got taken on some firewood on firewood i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didnt know and i stopped payment on the check and hed already been paid by a cashing firm and and theyre suing us theyre suing me on this and its for a hundred and thirty four dollars oh my absolutely pathetic i stopped payment on a check oh thats funny oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zaks and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they dont sue us over it laughter but we never received any merchandise either so i dont think it would hold any oh okay well something well probably something like that did you call them and tell them you just you just no we didnt even call them we just did it maybe my husband should call today might be a good idea because because youre going to get what a a check uh ,family_finance,2300
well how many credit cards do you have ive only ive got about four maybe i try to limit them because i well one i dont use them uh too much and i use my Visa just for about for about everything and i pay it all off so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically laughter sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out and it and it uh laughterit it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when ATT came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and weve been using that one uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i dont know do you know any people that run up big big bills im im you know im in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out well did um were you able to get one while youre in college um i dont think i ever tried just curious because i have a son thats a senior this year and hes heading off with any kind of luck but there has been ive had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that yeah i i you know its you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but just depends well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since its its in monitor the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one thats responsible but its yeah so basically if you want to take the risk yes its whether the parent wants to take the risk laughter its your risk do you trust your your son yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some vocalizednoise there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i im im leaning towards doing it for for convenience uhhuh id say do you know have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something a convenience yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble theres some some ways of getting out and that he doesnt have to carry cash the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i dont i dont i dont carry cash around and and uh i dont even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook and she writes the checks and i record them so its uh its uh its but its interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up with on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it its hard to believe that youd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess whats interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where theyre offering to extend payments on uh things like uh like the credit unions offering the the extended loan payment for your car yeah i saw that the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that theyre encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and well its its its business and theyre making money off that and they make more money if you extend your loan yeah and and its so its business so and you notice that theyre theyre only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old and so theyve already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and theyll recover the loan and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or anything theyre not going to keep on if the car were older the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks its i think its poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint so its interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year its ten percent or so yeah uh its uh its interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things what now whats ten percent we can deduct i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit i didnt know that oh if you had a thousand dollars that means theres another hundred dollar deduction ive given you i didnt think you could anything on a loan or yeah its on uh yeah i mean a mortgage i know you can yeah on the uh theres theres theres a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the oh ive never itemized yet oh okay so maybe thats its on its on schedule um schedule a or schedule a under uh well its the same place its the same place you put uh interest but but see thats what thats what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you cant you cant take out a a second mortgage uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh its fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to its not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint but uh anyway laughter yeah i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my Visa for for as much as i can and i pay it all off and sounds like youre youre very responsible very financially responsible its uh thats uh therere a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and hes got just enormous debts and hes uh but i mean what do you say its like shucks laughter boss im sure sorry youve got all that debt well hes had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i dont i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that  and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college and uh ill never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and im its its remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently thats been going on for a really long time i didnt do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year well you you think youre starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent and miscellaneous things like food and and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh its its its amazing how it what you learn yeah well yeah and and yeah so well anything else good to say about credit cards yeah theyre theyre convenient you know thats thats a i might just probably one big thing about them and you dont have to carry the cash and and uh and its its its certainly accepted more places than the places you know its hard to cash a check if youre out of state and yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff and now im out here in Phoenix they dont allow they dont do that they they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something yeah huh so uh carry all that cash with you that was interesting cause i always you know you didnt have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i well you know they they theyve started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you yeah ive heard about them yeah and i think thats where thats mostly locally the banks will line up with uh yeah ive seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores dont do that because of the the time frame which they get paid in general that uh they ive seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and you know almost well i guess its the day after uh technically its two days but they they they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought thered be just a little bit of float but apparently thats why the uh the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so anyway well its good talking to you all righty maybe well get across well cross paths again good night all righty take it easy ,credit_card,2313
well Bonny how do you do your budget we take the rent first you know we need to have a roof over our head and then we take the car you know we need a car to get back and forth to work and then its the utilities and then the food and then uh the regular bills you know your credit cards and your uh utilities and stuff like that i im trying to think what else phone the phone utilities come last or uh before lets see the utilities come before the food and the bills the uh credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans things like that they come before the uh uh they come after everything else theyre last on it because you know uh they theyre never late but theyre the least uh bothersome bothersome to us you know uh we need a roof and all that before we need anything else yeah i kind of think you ought to make make them wait until the last possible minute for it we do ours uh fairly similar course uh we both have married before and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills yeah well im a homemaker myself so he he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it should be and or the way whatever way we can i wish we could do that unfortunately between two divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good i can imagine i uh you know i havent gone through a divorce myself ive only been married once but uh i know a lot of people that have and a lot of thems got alimony and child support and all that oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about uh three thousand dollars a year for child support yeah i bet which is after i mean thats net thats thats right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it well thats better than having them living with you laughter theyre more expensive right there day in and day out thats what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff yeah i bet you do yeah but you know you know bills wise uh we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and uh my wife takes some of hers and we have an agreement that uh if were going to charge anything over like seventy five or eighty dollars then vocalizednoise we uh we talk about it yeah oh well me and my husband unless of course its uh its like for a present or whatever and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here laughter i love it when my husband decides to to say fudge with the budget and uh sneak a big gift in yeah i uh i was trying to finagle our budget around because uh my wife wanted she really wanted a little small five inch TV she could carry around the house or you know back in her sewing room whenever shes watching television ive got one of them and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money and so all through the year i i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come Christmas time were going to have that television set come hell or high water and sure enough we got it  well uh my motherinlaw gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago i dont think its five inches i think its a little bit bigger than that but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity so its a neat little thing to have how how do you divide uh you just divide up your uh the money just you just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there huh uh well they have we have direct deposit that helps a lot uh and uh first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead and uh you know he makes the same amount every week uh hes not its not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much hes going to get unless he works over and then its uh you know thats extra uh but hes got us situated to where we pay uh pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month and uh none of thems ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh it works out real well uh most problem we had was when uh lets see when was it something like we had a three pay uh weekends uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period and uh we was close to being uh oh shoot im trying to think its been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff and so that was pretty bad but i dont know i like that hes got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard hes got a stable schedule then everything kind of works out well yeah pretty much uh with the direct deposit thats what helps you know because he doesnt have the money in hand yeah if if if you dont have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well ill take five or ten dollars here oh well hes hes we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work and thats hard you know uh im sure youre vocalizednoise familiar with TI up here oh yeah and you know how they got the Texans uh that Texans Credit Union uhhuh Tex Tower yeah right there he uh hes good at uh getting into that but hes good hes you know we never in my i ive been married to him for seven years and weve never had a check bounce thats good and uh well no i take that back one time we did uh it didnt bounce but it came close we called our landlord and asked her to hold off on check cashing the check for three days laughter we was overdrawn six dollars thats not too bad that thats cutting it pretty close though  but uh it was i dont know weve never he weve had problems meeting our bills before but uh weve met them well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now not too much you can do about it between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does yeah thats whats going to hurt us in April uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt oh yeah so do we and yeah thats taking money that we didnt have you know that we had set aside for uh a bill or two and were trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by April yeah they want their money real quick thats the only bad part we got the same problem however i guess it uh beats the alternative just not having anything to start out with well i know how it is to start out with nothing uh you know oh yeah and uh im were up to where close to where we want to be but were not quite there yet well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it yeah i just can i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job but then id rather be with my kids well you know kids are important you got stay you have to stay home with the kids yeah well you know ive got a two year old and a four year old and uh well soon as they get in to school it wont it wont be so bad yeah but i know it would help with the bills well Bonny it it sounds like a pretty good idea tell you what uh i think we about done our about five minutes okay well it was nice talking to you okay well check you later all right byebye ,family_finance,2320
okay what is your uh general opinion then of of taxes for the Americans i dont think that im paying too many tax you know too much tax myself uh i uh as far as uh you know federal and state uh the uh the state i live in has a five percent sales tax uh its quite a bit different than uh Texas i dont know if youve ever been outside of Texas but uh when i moved to Texas i was told oh well theres no personal income tax well they nail you on property taxes in uh Texas and then thats how they get their money to take care of the schools and things right yeah uh as a matter of fact theyre talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not theyre not equitable within the state so theyre changing that theyre talking about changing the uh the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes either that or uh starting a state income tax yeah i i found it interesting uh when i moved to Texas the fact that uh the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the Plano school district because it was the best because it had more money than you know other places and uh i just um in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand itd be about sixty thousand down there laughter and um the tax basis is actually uh less than the full price of the house so you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at i think they only have the house valued at probably about  ninety or a hundred thousand dollars whereas when i was in Texas i notice that they put the tax basis at at almost the uh full price almost full value right yeah and so there was quite a difference there um i think that the way they they levy taxes is a little bit uh crazy i think if if they uh people and and ill use Plano as an example uh house prices in Plano were falling and so they decided well in order to get more tax revenue were going to have to raise the price uh you know were going to have to raise the uh the the uh tax per hundred dollars of value on the house and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people werent buying the existing family homes so they were shooting themselves in the foot and you know if they just would have thought well gee if we dont you know if we put a freeze on new home starts that will bring the price of houses back up our tax base revenue will go up and we wont have to increase taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here yeah guess thats a possibility uh as i understand it Maryland does not have any uh state income tax is that right no no they do have state income tax oh okay so yeah thats and they uh they divide it up by um you know you pay a state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties okay then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes that is correct okay did you live in Texas after the uh after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return um yes i did i only lived in Texas in eighty seven and um eighty eight and uh part of eighty nine okay so so you couldnt deduct state income uh state sales tax when you lived in Texas so what do you think about the difference between those two situations in Texas i was oh i believe the uh tax sales tax was somewhere around seven eight eight percent here in Maryland its only five um it was nice to have that uh you know deduction when it was available uh but when they revamped the you know supposedly making things more fair um ive heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food arent going to be out buying you know anything else and the the people that you know have the uh disposable income that are probably more able to pay the income tax uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and theyre out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um there was theres another crazy thing that gets me its like the more children you have the less tax you pay and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it its kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesnt make sense to me youre getting more services yeah laughter you know your children are going you know youve got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you theyre paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesnt make sense yeah thats thats an interesting uh interesting concept i hadnt thought about that how you you you know that thats right i guess laughter in a sense i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that but uh you know i understand what youre where youre coming from with the yeah now the other side of the question is about are we getting what were paying for um for the most part i think we are but there is a lot of inefficiency uh both on the federal level and on the state level and uh hopefully well you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe well be able to streamline it um i havent kept up with uh the Texas politics other than that dirty little uh governor fight but i mean uh we have a a governor here in Maryland whos uh pretty hard nosed and uh hes you know were three hundred fifty million dollars short and every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money everybody starts screaming and yelling and uh every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try to do something you know they start screaming yelling they wont let him raise the taxes and and they they wont let him cut any programs and hes like what do you guys want me to do laughteri laughtermean yeah thats i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh is were were talking about having uh national uh military or or public service deal for young people maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs if uh you know if were going to do that then we ought to really get some benefit dollar benefits out of it that uh to reduce spending in some other areas uh you know to do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments because uh thats i think thats where our real you know the real problem with government is not is not what the not what the governments doing but where its spending its money its its encouraging people to to uh not do as well as they can you know uh not have as much output and all that youre paying people not to work and youre paying people to have more kids and you know like you said you know more kids you have the more dependents you have you know the allowances you get and uh the more you have the more uh aid for dependent children you can get and all of these things go into it so but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so yeah that and i think uh putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own and that you know the states would take care of the communities and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government right it uh and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know theres a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way and uh maintenance and overhead and you know and and those kind of costs yeah right i i think that a a big part of the uh you know the government concept over the last fifty years has been uh redistribution of uh of wealth in in effect uh you know you you tax the people that have the most and the people that dont have anything get it for nothing and uh and i dont think thats the American way myself it uh it kind of rings of you know socialism and and i just i dont understand why the American leaders uh seem to think that thats the way to go you know that uh there are not i dont think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for or making the American system work in the way its originally designed to yeah there theres uh you know once you reach a certain plateau in in finances um ,taxes,2327
all right well like i told you before laughter and youre talking about  credit cards  we put ours up i mean i had a delightful evening one laughternight cutting a bunch of those suckers up um i wish i had well you should try it well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going and this was back in the eighties i dont know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that but uh i had a coin shop and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom you lost your business oh God what a laughternightmare yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bankruptcy you know it was one of those things  uh oh itll get better next week you know  things will pick up and so there i was in old bankruptcy court well you werent charging gold and silver were you you cant do that can you oh yeah yeah oh you can  oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it  oh thats a nightmare  yeah course on on stuff that i was vocalizednoise on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because i was selling it i wasnt buying you know just to hold onto it but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up well  i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college theyll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them all out because youre honored laughterright and uh i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well thats okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right  i wasnt thinking a thing about it umhum yes thats the way they suck you in yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because you know got get such good bargains  and i dont know   well just today in the mail i got uh i got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express oh yeah weve been getting those i went back to school and got my Masters and they started sending those things to me again yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name yeah they did and uh course i guess i guess ive been purged from their records i used to have an American Express uh back when i had my business i got one they they goofed up bad on my first on my very first bill because i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses and the bill would come in and id pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying youre overdue pay so i i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didnt do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier and said were going to turn this over to our attorneys if you dont pay and i looked at that and i said uhhuh so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks and now they werent check in yeah they were i tell you they dont talk about they were charging that enormous fee every year now what is it now its up to fifty five on the gold card its eighty five for the Optima oh im sorry no fifty fifty what do you mean fifty five you mean fifty five dollars yeah for the green card and it but then whats the interest well now and thats thats the card fee and interest is like eighteen or something oh yeah yeah its um well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isnt any but on the Optima card its um  lets see right now its running at about its not too bad its actually its about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go credit cards  well theyre dangerous you know my parents dont hardly use them humum mine dont either mine dont either they have um my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and thats it ive got all my gas cards because i dont want to carry money around ill do that  yeah yeah now i i do use gas cards vocalizednoise now Impact is kind of bad too though yeah  yeah yeah laughter you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers oh yeah exactly laughter uh plastic is just too easy i mean thats the thats the whole problem with it um have well and youre tempted if youve got cash a little bit of cash and you dont have enough for the purchase right of course you got to charge it and keep your cash naturally thats i got in all kinds of trouble doing that laughter baside what what are you saying easide oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i i dont really usually consider that an option laughter maybe thats how we got in laughtertrouble having having having been out of the credit game for some years now ive ive gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it and uh yeah but its hard isnt it well it is but i i im kind of uh grateful for the experience because its taught me a lot of restraint well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic yeah exactly i i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday with cash with cash and it its do you work with TI no no i wish i did laughter yeah you could have got a discount couldnt you yeah i could use a discount laughter i have to wait for the things to go on sale laughter  but theres always a sell yeah especially on electronic goods especially now what is that thing i saw Circuit Circuit world or something oh Circuit City Circuit City have you been in that  yeah they theyre not their prices arent that terrific they they used to be but theyve gotten theyve got to pay for all that national advertising now oh its national i think ive seen two around Dallas yeah theyre theyre all over the country now they uh they they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains well what else  i dont know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise yeah in Garland you you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now so so much for Circuit City  okay what else can we talk about who do you work for i dont im a graduate student im a professional student  sounds wonderful we were talking about that just today it is its its great we could be just lifelong students it is great i love it where are you going to school NC State whats that uh North Carolina State so youre on Spring Break not yet  ours dont ours doesnt start until uh next week so where are you where am i what do you mean where oh in Raleigh oh okay yeah good ole vocalizednoise the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh what what a dead laughterplace yeah is it laughter ive got a nice little business at home and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time so what are you getting your degree in  um uh human factors and what do you do with it not a thing laughter well what is it uh its its its really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them so its sociology its well its more psychology and engineering uh my my masters is in industrial engineering so youre working on your doctorate oh lord yeah PhD in human factors oh thatll thatll sound wonderful wont it  laughter well get you a little name plaque oh yeah IBM uh i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what im looking at right now arent arent they laying off several thousand people they might be but not at not at the human factors level  well i heard it on the news today i could swear it was IBM there there um no as a matter of fact the IBM right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person doggone it if theyd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me how much longer do you have um im vocalizednoise im going into thesis or going into the uh dissertation this summer and get that done this summer uh im going to start this summer i probably wont finish it until the end of the year but uh im im trying to get a uh a uh intern position with IBM right now so that i can laughterfind an area to do my laughterdissertation in laughter its hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field because you why there been so much work done already yeah thats that and and its its limited application in some respects um consider in the area that were in here theres a lot of places that use human factors people most ,credit_card,2334
the taxes tend to uh keep going up but uh i dont know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well theres always someone thats  thats worse off in what they end up paying but uh go ahead i think i think were always convinced that were paying too much in taxes without getting back necessarily everything wed like to but so far i dont think ive paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet yeah im still still im able to survive and and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money its almost like youre paying your own salary i dont work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days its still uh still a feeling of you know its not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way uh that helps the rationale any but its still angering to see the abuses uh even though theyre uh a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when theyre you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and whats happening in that area its still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes desire that that money not be spent well do you all pay state income tax no no Texas doesnt have a state income tax yet thats neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part theyve just started talking about introducing a state income tax and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent well by the time the city gets involved im not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent so its its pretty pretty much but i think its divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some and its its quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere but were in a particular part of the state thats pretty well off so its its like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes well thats good yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and theres a lot of lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so its its a real mixed blessing i guess to thats i think thats the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots and i i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again yeah itd be nice if you could find someone uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then youd have to find a way to make it work laughter i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R laughter yeah yeah the uh bureaucracy seems to spend more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic cant see the forest for the trees i i wonder if if they realize so it make the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and well have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever and they just keep trying to to close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all theyre doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse and i dont i dont think theyre getting their moneys worth and i i i definitely dont think that the added steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think its just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws they will find a way if they want to badly enough theyll either find it themselves or theyll find someone to do it for them it does seem to be the case i dont know whether its worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every dollar you make or spend it gets uh steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everythings going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction i dont know what what would happen if we uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving its not a you know a tax your income because now youre talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff but if you put the burden on the retailer who really doesnt care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesnt care who bought the groceries youre going to pay the tax on it so vocalizednoise most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our income income brackets right laughter so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didnt save they wouldnt have to get or what they could could save they wouldnt get taxed on and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way its so simple that people would be afraid to try it yeah but you wouldnt be able to steer people toward a particular type of savings you wouldnt be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRAs and all that they you wouldnt be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money and it didnt have the taxation problem well you might might do all right i dont know it seems yeah even if you didnt invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest you youd still be ahead thats for sure and thats something thats something i need to to learn a lot more about is is under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future because thats a thats a scary thought you always hear that Social Security wont be around by the time were sixty three or sixty five and and need it and thats a scary thought thats true plus what what there will be of it even if its there isnt quite enough anyway laughterso youre looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didnt go away yeah the uh the taxes are are kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things weve written into it but uh looking looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there its not all that pleasant anywhere we still look pretty good dont we yeah pretty much well i hear one of my kiddos doing something they shouldnt be so ill uh let you go and maybe its been nice talking to you maybe maybe well catch each other again okay have a good evening ill try bye thanks byebye ,taxes,2341
hi Ellen um do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your monthly expenses no we dont really do anything formal um i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the laughterspending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and i just sort of know what we can and cant do and it you know its worked pretty well i havent really gotten into any major problems without having something formal yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term well yeah yeah we have uh you know like a typical credit union account for you know just a a basic savings thing and then uh weve got you know the IRAs and CDs and various and sundry you know long term kinds of things uh yeah how about you okay thats uh uh we used to budget when the children were small things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing and our savings werent that great but now the kids are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh finally getting out of college this uh May so weve we dont budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what youre going to spend uh week to week or or you have your monthly bills at a fixed um as far as electricity and telephone and um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal for retirement you know they take out for CODA and then uh um the IRAs and then uh i also take out for um a savings account but its its uh um its not really savings its savings if we dont spend it laughter well i know yeah its like a floating you know if something if something comes up yeah or if you want to take a trip or something that you you plan it but thats where you get the money is right yeah yeah thats thats the way we work it it it it doesnt come out um it doesnt come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh years and years and years and now im getting up towards retirement age so we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and were going maxed out on CODA and then you know other things like you know CDs but this other its in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend thats what we hit or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant um thatll come out of that rather than put it on a credit card oh thats sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then weve got that little cushion in there that you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is yeah so it you dont have to really dig into long term or or you know well you cant cash in a CD thats kind of ridiculous um yeah no i never go like to go into those things that are like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they uh vocalizednoise i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you dont use it and you sort of dont see it then its its safe in a laughtersense right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and theyll say you know well youve got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever but yeah its its its kind of forced on you because you suffer a penalty so thats yeah thats one of the thats one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh CODA definitely i mean thats a good deal thats yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with i dont know i mean thats fantastic you know they match it um my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasnt been working for a couple of years her father took sick so shes been taking care of him but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers steam or momentum and you dont realize it you know it just piles up yeah thats a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or um yeah we we took out actually my wife shes the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up  so much went for groceries so much went for the mortgage because we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil we heated with oil  we they put us on a budget they would run like uh vocalizednoise they could really tell how much oil you were going to use so they budgeted it at year round so in the summer time which you didnt use very little oil you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when youre using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didnt go out to eat that often but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it it it became a chore well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that yeah i talked to to uh other people and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries um but even at that point you know shed say oh you know we we need this or the budgets not doing this or that uh course me i didnt run it like she ran it like you run it now laughter well and its pretty much the same she still does the same thing everythings fixed you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay so we dont have to do anything there and the rest of it as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank yeah i do that too so we dont really see anything if if i need something ill go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something shell go and shell use the teller machine so we dont really um have a lot of cash anymore yeah i i walk around sometimes and ive got if ive got five dollars in my pocket thats thats a lot its yeah i used to take money out for gas and groceries and things like that and i dont even do that anymore i mean i just dont have that much cash on me yeah for your automobile umhum right you mean gas vocalizednoise yeah and now i dont know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because i always put my gas on a credit card and i pay it at the end of the month so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go so you dont even have to go in to see the teller anymore works pretty good then yeah yeah its not bad so you dont need you dont need money for gasoline you dont need money you know incidentals for coffee when i come into work in the morning and things like that but other than that um it looks like were probably going towards a cashless society yeah to some extent i guess so because if youre doing that you know and im sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas um and were doing it most most of the people up here that work have already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union so they dont deal much in cash anymore either if we so it looks like were both running about the same maybe younger people are different im not sure yeah they probably dont have enough to laughter thats right they dont have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know vocalizednoise i look at mine and hes getting out of school and im saying geez you know im glad im not starting out now because things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes yeah we were having some problems here too still because you guys ran into it a while back yeah theyre still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there oh yeah its not just yeah its not just TI they theyre doing the same thing up here and not just uh in yesterdays newspaper they said um IBMs going through theyre going to lay off like fourteen thousand world wide well yeah that really is scary So its still there unfortunately um ,family_finance,2348
well a large organization offers uh usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and and medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need and one thing that ive found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the the local government pays you its nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case thats true so uh and you get sequestered or something then youre there for months when when you get sequestered and youre there for months right that would be uh a problem of course in my job i dont know who would do it while im gone that long were desperately trying to find time to uh train someone else to do it but i feel certainly it would still be there if if not burying me but laughteruh laughteritll laughterbe laughterthere laughterwhen laughteri laughterget laughterback uh flex times another benefit that i i like that TIs been doing uh though officially they just started it uh uh relatively recently uh we were always given the privilege with our supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didnt interfere with anyone and he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shifts concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and and later on well eight to nine oclock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five oclock time frame and it really worked out well and then then of course they came long and sanctioned it and and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didnt want any of us starting before six thirty so uh it wasnt too much of a blow but uh the people that we were interfacing with didnt like that laughtertoo laughterwell yeah right they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but uh its its nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours thats thats a real benefit what have you found that you like in a big organization well as as you say the the um benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that it is a boom a a a plus to have that even as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it because its not out of pocket money and it they also have good insurance uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRAs uh the profit sharing the stock options there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is and um i think that uh a a lot of its the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job and the um MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people and theyre uh meetings to keep you full informed you dont find that much in small companies because you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think its great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us whats going on that type of thing um do you we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think thats a good deal it gives you a chance to feel like youre a part of a group or the organization and that youre heard and know and if you have ideas that type of thing umhum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay oh i use it up laughter theres a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and and uh im still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day one day a week so on Thursdays do you have a mandatory excuse me uh do you have a mandatory shut down no we dont have uh we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesnt apply were so busy year round yeah oh thats why see see you can youre able to do that but we havent got much choice right too thats the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to take it when you want to yeah but were not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that theyre supplying but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know youre not in the same area so you have to take a two week shut down and its not at the same time so that isnt too nice uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time oh boy to eliminate that and that youre talking about five thousand people so thats quite a feat in itself yeah it is weve got um if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to uh take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works uh oh i starts about eleven or twelve oclock uh at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight thats just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that that that seldom and in those hours and she didnt mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and she worked that day and then occasional Saturdays and uh with with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a a Thursday during the summer i still dont eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so oh thats great its its kind of nice to be able to do both and uh ill probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves yeah really thats excellent so yeah its nice to have these little little benefits that i know wouldnt uh wouldnt happen in a real small company several of my friends have left uh the Metroplex is just full of little companies and theyve left TI to go to a little company and and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and it just wasnt as convenient as being able to say well tomorrow i think i will laughteryou laughterknow yeah yeah and uh then they dont have quite the job security although you know now theres a lot of people getting cut but still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry uh if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then youre probably pretty secure on that contract well theyre doing a lot with um automation specialist also thats what i do uh where you have to go to school to or run the new automated automated equipment its all computerized and and stuff and uh theres a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where youre able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh diagnose whats wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things and interface with the technicians in the toolroom so youre kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes and um its about a two year to three year experience before youre able to really um i would say payback you know and and do the job well well thats good and youre still learning even after all that time because theyre very complex machines yeah its good that you can pick up something that adds to both your your security and your knowledge base laughter exactly thats right youre getting two things at once there well have and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school thats another good uh benefit that TI has and theyll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that youll work for them for five years or uh you know to that affect and youre kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you cant if youre you know signed in a contract whereas at TI they dont do that yeah ive ive looked at several uh courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job uh that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like uh all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like theres one in Washington DC laughterand theres one in Oregon and theyre theyre just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but um well this part of the country theres no shortage shortage of uh good schools well we have we have lots of you know like MIT and and uh Bostons only uh an hours drive from here so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school and right in Rhode Island there are some nice colleges too Rhode Island college and we have lots of uh schools they just only only one in the entire area offers a course in whats called ,job_benefits,2361
okay um do you have a credit card oh laughter who doesnt have credit laughtercards i know ive got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one i dont know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right up and now ive after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and im still paying it off oh i know its its Christmas is the worst time for i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible i dont know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is its a pain paying it off oh yeah uhhuh i i dont i dont know um i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and ive put saved up enough money where im going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there oh thats good thats really good yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars oh i know i know but um i dont know i never i never liked loans a lot so im not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards and theyve just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them its it its just unreal i guess i know its easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things oh yeah it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you dont dont really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes oh of course even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know you got to be they say you have to dress for success laughter yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time you know uh get please get get get and youre already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff you know they just try to uh to to get you to get uh have their credit card and um you know uh six half a dozen isnt enough laughter laughter how many credit cards do you have oh i have one we well we have we have one one Master Card thats pretty good yeah my oh my husband wont even put his name on it i dont believe in those its like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it yeah laughter because youve got to have a credit card to rent a car yes you do uhhuh yes you do yes you do and that that uh down here uh you have to have a credit uh you just cant live without it because down here they dont take a check unless you got credit card and drivers license identification yep thats right up here at some stores if its if youre not in your home town you have to show them a credit card yeah uh its its just a another form of identification you know just to well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if thats why theyre taking it i mean i dont know how fair that is oh yes oh yeah they can but i dont know um yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent uh theyre all well ours is ours is through our our credit union and its thirteen so its yeah thirteen thats not bad thats not thats really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme high its its uh and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express youre really its not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that its really expensive isnt it is it i i dont know we dont uh we dont ive never had one my husband has one for to for uh for business its a company card but hes never had to use it so we dont get any get anything uh for it thats good laughter i mean we we we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but but so far hes never had to use it so we dont know anything about the billing yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month do they uh uh ooh laughter yeah because its uh that could get you in awful lot of trouble laughter i know especially if your uh your reimbursement didnt come through laughter from your company because i know they i dont know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and you can use that i dont know why you cant use other credit cards for business that way i dont i dont know i think its uh just a lot of companies prefer American American Express yeah i i dont know if its easy for them to get or or or what but um uh but i guess its its run so much different from the other ones yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards vocalizednoise you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa yeah laughter i bet you there i bet you there are people that do that oh i i im sure there are i mean uh laughter you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other you take oh gee oh gee oh they i think they charge more for cash advances so do they um its its some cards you you can do that and some cards you cant down here i think it just depends on what the what the banks will take well it yeah you cant get cash advances oh so on on uh on some cards uhhuh well i saying through my bank vocalizednoise they they since they have their own card they dont like to give advances through other for other cards oh well no uh it laughter i think thats a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually that that doesnt solve anything no it doesnt that just laughter laughter be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back yeah vocalizednoise because its still there laughter its just some place else laughternow i know i dont credit cards almost seem unfair to a person whos whos got a victim of impulse buying oh yeah store credit cards like unfair advertising or something store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa because i i had a i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent oh wow so i i cut i cut that thing up laughter so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders oh really yeah its its the thing if if a business is taking a credit card theyre really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends because it is a four percent that they take uh i didnt know three or four percent i dont know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank i used to take it off the deposit oh how awful vocalizednoise you do have to take it off your deposit yeah so it is a a service that theyre offering yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist i i know should own stock there instead of these uh uh banks going that are folding but well but everybodys really trying to you know its become a real national problem credit card debt and and i weve really cut i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars its got to be billions of dollars it it is it is it they uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt and what theyre talking about is credit cards thats uh probably true i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan and then theres all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards i dont know if they count uh mortgages as personal debt thats personal vocalizednoise maybe they dont i dont im not sure that they do i think uh what theyre talking about like vocalizednoise is uh credit cards and other junk vocalizednoise and loan car loans things like that because uh boy i know people who kids people right out of college the credit card people like to get you because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real laughtertrouble i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken confiscate her credit cards vocalizednoise i mean i dont know its probably theyre always saying the women are doing vocalizednoise are the spending ones but i havent heard one uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man laughter well i dont know um i i definitely want to get mine up mine paid off month to month like i used to and just as soon as i get it paid off ill probably get laid off laughter terrible cant afford my credit card anymore oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic ,credit_card,2390
okay um lets see how do you feel about laughtercredit cards laughter personally i do not care for them uh although i find them a necessity in business and so forth i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible for a number of reasons one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express and uh im not  im not terribly in favor of them not for my own personal uh point of view plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least thats one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard do you use them frequently or well we uh me and my wife when when we have like extra money that we know were going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah well well use it but like last year i think we paid um i think it was like twenty something cents interest on our Visa and i think this this year we uh i think we used it for Christmas and we got caught just a few days on our grace period and uh so well pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars but we dont like to do that at all and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly we uh we have several credit cards though um we have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express and i think we have a couple of department stores but we use it the same way and uh i find the one i use mostly uh aside from the American Express i do use my Sears card i try vocalizednoise as with the American Express i try to pay it you know as it comes in right right so uh its its not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill thats usually how we do it i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my American Express card before i would before i left i would mail a check to to American Express you know have some idea of how much was there you know id sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever i felt i would spend and then use it then but uh you know for hotels and and so forth but uh but i knew that it was paid i knew laughter i knew that i had that much credit going in sometimes you know sometimes i would go over but uh it wouldnt you know it wouldnt hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect well thats good ive i dont think weve gone that far weve laughterbeen before laughter to pay it in advance you know in advance before we spend it but i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good well i found you know i found in um in traveling overseas that uh it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card oh really for uh for hotel bills and so forth plus i would uh when they would send the bill and they would automatically convert to the exchange rate right right now the only time time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically uh for example i remember on one trip to France when i started planning the trip i think uh a dollar was worth nine or ten francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically and when when i finally got over there it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the laughter so i got caught a little short in that regard but uh uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh lets say if it were say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so or maybe twenty dollars maybe it would be more than that it was more than vocalizednoise it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate right right but then laughter when i got back and i was working for the government at the time uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate right yeah so theres a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate that that was the only time i really got caught short and i yeah especially but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard yeah well thats thats good and it yeah yeah well from where are you calling oh from the Dallas area so youre from Dallas okay im from Maryland oh really yeah laughter wow vocalizednoise do you work for TI no i work for GTE well really um uh i wonder how TI got GTE involved well i know Jack Godfrey oh okay i know him very well ive known Jack for a long time and im also in the speech business oh okay so when i heard that Jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this and uh so thats how i got involved yeah you have a very um very whats the word your your speech is very exact oh thank you very much laughter but uh vocalizednoise laughter as Jack said im one of the uh the old hands in the speech business i ive ive uh yes i ive been doing it for twenty some odd years oh really and so uh uh i was very much interested in uh getting involved in uh switchboard uh you work for TI right i i work in uh a wafer fab oh really oh i guess were supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording laughter yeah laughter i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject so i think you get ten so laughter well all right i think were okay okay fine well you have a good evening well well you too its been pleasant talking to you same here take care good night ,credit_card,2399
all right well credit cards laughter i have some do you laughter laughter well yeah i i ive used them a bit too much sometimes laughter yes me too yeah uh do you have uh like the Visa and MasterCard and and those that are those the ones that you use the the most or well i have uh weve got an American Express which we got that on purpose so we could pay that off every month that way we we know our limit but then i also have department stores and um you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isnt too bad its just your normal yeah just a pretty pretty pretty much uh what you can pay monthly anyway you know getting clothes and stuff every once in awhile yeah well we have uh have department store cards for nearly all the department stores i guess uh uh but but we dont you know dont use them a lot uh but we do have uh Visa cards uh my wife has uh has an American Express through her through the company and uh i dont even have an American Express to use for business so or i use a Visa all the time just your Visa yeah right and uh i i find that they you know they work all right i havent found anybody that will will turn one down yeah i you know uh people always complain about American Express saying not enough people take it but ive ive rarely found a place that wouldnt that wouldnt take it so that doesnt bother me luckily the uh yeah its its uh it is convenient to have that you know and it and if you can do a the a lot more with the American Express when we do when we go traveling uh the American Express works a lot better for some things because you can charge you know airline tickets oh does it and and get some benefits from that i think too thats true thats true thats thats real nice to you know but its i tell you its its really uh its tough to uh to deal with when you let your your balances build up you know so that it its thats true youve we did it uh intentionally i did it intentionally i was running some business expenses through the Visa card so i knew that i was running a balance up but it sure is hard to get it paid back i know paid back down it uh when we first got married we you know went and got all the credit cards and of course charged those puppies up and its oh boy when those bills start coming in they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there but uh you know you find its uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh uhhuh uhhuh that weve been paying real close attention to that so were using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union thats good credit card i think has the lowest about the lowest interest rate of any of the ones that we use thats good ive noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments yeah laughter you know its like whoa laughter wait a minute dont pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up so thats what i normally try to do if its pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time and get it down quicker but theyre easy to use so you havent been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then no have you i have been tempted i just i saw one of those ads on TV last night that you know somebody call in right now you know and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard but uh i dont understand how they do that and uh of course its a nine hundred number which that means theyre going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call but they say you cant be turned down and i dont understand how they can well the thing is the that a lot of those are like theyre set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing and you have to have a deposit in that you know that deal of you know if you want a five hundred dollar credit line then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance in there i see well then they sure they wont turn you down because theyve got your money sure theyve got your money already well gosh yeah yeah but thats yeah i know thats the way some of them work anyway well thats darn easy then laughter yeah laughter i wouldnt turn you down either ill give you one laughter right yeah huh no i havent attempted that im satisfied with what we have right now and we do have a gas credit card and we use that yes uh yeah thats one that we dont use uh ive had uh you know had different companies or you know gas company cards before but i didnt use them we we usually spend cash you know pay cash for gas and then uh most of the places will take uh the Visa card anyway so right thats true thats true so i i can use that and uh well we uh my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then its nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that its its a good deal i think yeah but theyre of course now theyre beginning to to get the picture i think uh like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back yeah i saw that so they quit charging the extra i dont whether they they drop their price back to the cash price or raised all their prices up to the charge price laughter vocalizednoise yeah exactly but they wont they wont charge i saw that advertised too thats a good deal but its real convenient its real convenient for me i really i just like being able to go in and do that but uh and and its like American Express you have to pay it off at the end of the month so huh yeah its not going to go up too high so its good for emergencies right yeah thats its always handy to have that that credit card for whatever it is that you might need it for thats what we do on thats true we always use especially on trips you know we just charge all our gas that saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then yeah thats it when when we travel its we used to use our the gas card just for that you know uhhuh right and now we dont have of course we dont drive on our trips very much anymore either we used to drive like wed drive to New Orleans twice a year oh yeah and uh we dont go we dont we dont drive anymore when we go down there we usually fly so you know you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive so i know and isnt that terrible yeah so and save all that money yeah so anyway well do you think weve i think theyve got enough uh enough information from us anyway laughter okay well thanks for talking okay its nice talking to you okay byebye  you too byebye ,credit_card,2409
get us going are are you at TI Austin or well i left TI in January but i signed up for this before i did oh thats great no uh uh my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us i have another one and shes talked to students uh so i guess they have uh sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things so theyre if youre a computer user so my daughter has talked to two students uh that were non TIers so i guess oh yeah oh i think thats a thats a good idea all right were were on finances have you have you retired or uh oh no no no no laughter actually i left TI um i had basically set my sights to leave TI when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one because i i definitely definitely need to make a little more money and uh i havent really accomplished that yet but im trying oh yeah oh yeah its uh thats the finances i guess were on the subject of finances it is tough uh ive been with TI im just going to be fifteen years this year and thats a tough thing uh the salary thing TI doesnt quite always do it right well what about our our our financial budget well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if youre uh i wish i did i i hope youre youre a person who does things better than i i dont have a budget thats one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good oh long range planning budget mode um im a single mom and ive been just uh trying to get well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess laughter laughter thank you its nice to have someone understand that right sure how how about yourself do you have a budget you live by well i guess i do i do have a long term budget because i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that ive been thinking about that for quite a while now monthly monthly no ill tell you a funny story about budgeting uh ive been married twenty six years and i did you know that the macho thing the man always did the bills for i dont know fifteen years or more and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget uh one and i always tried to show my wife you know heres how you once a year id say heres how you do the budget in case i get sick or heres how you do the checks you know one day i gave her the checkbook and i said im not doing this anymore you do it you learn it and ive been happy ever since well thats great how about your she does it all now for about ten years and i dont even she complains to me about it she threatens me to give it back to me and i said ive been a happy man since i havent fooled with that checkbook you know laughter so i know its a big pain to try to do that it really is it it really is you know uh that was always a a major problem in our marriage what i have always identified is i am basically good with money it i dont really need a budget to tell me not to spend it i think that comes from never having enough you know im always afraid of laughter im going to need some and where will it be  right oh yeah so um no i ive ive finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget when i when i was first divorced i had um i sat down and budgeted and i had outgo that was what much higher than what i had coming in yes i think uh that is a tough uh we all seems to think seems to be that way i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me and and so now that ive gotten you know i lost the house now that ive gotten past that i can sit down and say okay this is the reality this is how much money i have each month the scary thing is as far as long term i dont have anything i dont know if you have an IRA or uh you know and ive got two girls also and i havent saved anything for their college and yeah thats you need to do that ill ill ill give you a hint i dont know if youre a talk a radio talk uh person listener do you listen to radio talk shows sometimes i have listen to Bruce Williams uh for financial advice hes on oh i dont know what hes going to be in Austin hes on five seventy here international oh hes nationally famous hes a college graduate type guy hes been in all hes an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff his name is Bruce Williams hes on national radio uh i dont know what it would be down there you might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there hes on that channel its uh its five seventy up here well ill check that out and id listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when im doing chores and uh he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff and and youve learned a lot he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially well thats thats good to know how yeah there theres a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget and i im not expert again because i dont really do it monthly well you must have done something youre youre helping your children in school and youre you know right i did start a college fund im not uh i have one again at UT down there now her first year and shes almost gone through her whole college fund laughteryou laughterknow uhhum uhhum  excuse me Jim could you hold on i have someone at the door ill be right back sure go ahead sure thank you i think we might have just screwed up the computer but well find out oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh uh the only advice i give you on college would be theres a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth and you ought to as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship money because there is a lot of money out there and uh  and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on uh band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip through bands through leadership uh theres all kinds of civic organizations organizations that will give you you know one shot money uh you get a presidents award if youre youre in in high school doing certain this up area in Arlington uh theres a lot of and of course you if you you score high on the SAT you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades she she did very well in school and uh but she only got first year money she got about two thousand dollars it was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization we called there were there were two or three people there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away and only two or three people applied she applied and got five hundred dollars from that wow oh im definitely going to be uh actively looking into that look into that bit the year that they graduate you know before though you know while theyre graduating theres all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything and they dont even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes its just uh like our band gave money away were a band booster club we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so well thats great to know theres money out there yeah thats good go ahead you can talk i i dont want to i want to chew up the whole line here oh well youre doing youre doing just fine and and uh actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions i was wondering what you do at TI oh im an engineer im uh in fact im working the night uh because of the cutbacks and everything uh my job there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved and so they put me on nights i i call this my recession job and im working nights just kind of covering uh shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here i dont mind oh goodness umhum umhum uh it beats being laid off and everything and uh you you got to be a little flexible uh in my old age im trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school oh absolutely and then id like to teach maybe mathematics or something im trying to study for that now oh i hope you can do that what what i did is i was approached and and ive i went to TI just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending i had been a right uh a stay at home mom and and i i vocalizednoise was very fortunate in starting and i really enjoyed it while i was at TI but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening and i had less than five years and also i wanted to make a little bit more money so i decided id like to go out and try sales and uh im im out trying to sell oh yeah telephone systems to businesses and the potential there is fantastic the reality of it is its tough laughter oh sure well its tough right now for everybody up here in the Dallas Metroplex its awful hey ive got another clue for you for college another clue for you for college money go to work for UT uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for TCU you know up here they give you scholarship a hundred percent if youre if you work for TCU they do yes so check that one out you know im going to check that ive got ive got two friends that work at at UT i didnt know that at all definitely i will ask them about it call them and because its full full scholarship now its uh not room and board but its tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at TCU well that sounds fantastic and her her her uh mother went over there just for that ,family_finance,2418
there we go well uh what do you think about taxes do you think were paying too much yes and no income tax no i uh i look at it this way uh youve got to pay for the privilege of living here but uh being a uh  a rec vehicle owner well in fact i live in a motor home im a full what they call a full timer and uh it burns gas like crazy i only get seven miles to the gallon i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes and they call it uh uh whats the word they use anyway a luxury a luxury tax they gave add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor and it doesnt bother me any because ive quit drinking and i quit smoking so that doesnt bother me but i dont think its fair its its too um um its attacking just certain people how true and even with the gasoline tax yeah well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know its thats not what i would consider a luxury no uh vocalizednoise fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury but its a necessity today and uh as hard as they try to get these public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that uh really really got off the ground or that accomplish what they set out to accomplish to accomplish what are your feelings on it well um i i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what were getting for it and how its being managed and so forth i mean i i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money its totally out of our hands so we dont we cant really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and yeah that thats thats so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day but not really no you dont look what happened on the last presidential election read my lips and what happened they turned around and double crossed us so uh i mean you you cant believe what you what you hear well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and dont seem to have any validity at all i mean theyre always far out and uh you know theyre studying some uh bug laughteryou laughterknow laughterin laughtersome laughterother laughterpart laughterof laughterthe laughterworld or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think thats wrong uh yes vocalizednoise i agree and and uh uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries we need enough help here in this country thats right theyre still people starving people here why should we help starving people somewhere else yeah and i think here lately theyve been saying quite often and maybe somebodys coming to realize that were the nation in trouble absolutely absolutely now i cant wait for uh i i could just picture whats whats going to happen here in the not to distant future we keep hearing well were going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh uh uh the uh uh the the the big war over there in the Mideast the war and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything and uh the next thing you know well be turning turning around just like we did to Poland and say well just forget it and i think thats a mistake somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we cant just keep giving it away  oh definitely well another thing now they they keep the decontrolling different things first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and what not we know what trouble they got into laughter exactly and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled and and uh uh transcontinental or um um um um interstate uh trucking i mean as soon as the uh the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket uh prices went uh sky high you know in the in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until theyre theyre reach the point where theyre cutting their own throat and uh well of course thats getting away from taxes isnt it that thats government controlled but um well i i think another thing too that um ive had a little contacted with uh in regard to taxes lets say that um you have something that the IRS disagrees with or you know says hey were not going to allow that well i think theyre very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double that amount and oh by the time you get through with the uh yes and thats to me theres something wrong there you know the penalties yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time uh i agree i think the IRS is uh just too powerful there should be some sort of a control on it and they should be a little more humane umhum absolutely uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess uh thats thats one of my pet peeves  i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget very simple give uh uh uh government employees the average number of of uh holidays as the uh uh the private industry i mean you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year thats a lot it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten well i havent counted i i would have guessed eight even but you might be right i dont have any idea well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more a day or so more than the average but uh government is ridiculous just think of the money they could save i mean theyre theyre paying out this money anyway why not get the work out of the people and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes but uh as far as income tax is concerned i cant complain too much about it um im single i have no uh dependents or anything my children are all grown and theyre out worrying about their own income taxes well i i have another thing that i thought about too um for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is and you know were not typically talking about big dollars but here you feel like youve youve done something good youve youve earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much um very true thats you know its kind of a vicious circle there and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it IRAs or something and and when and then they took that away as far as when you turn when you turn sixty five why then you pay the tax on it and the tax is a lot less but in the mean time you used used them youve got your money tide up in a low relatively low interest uh bearing investment i mean its not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today um me im a firm believer in that if you got it spend it well you can come over to my house and spend it laughter laughter well you i wish i had some to spend laughter well do you do you need some help spending yours  no no i dont i just dont have laughterany oh uhhuh well thats my problem too im im trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month thats going to get paid yeah thats the way it goes  well i guess we probably talked just about long enough  yeah uh let me ask you something did you get a catalog or something from these people yet you did ive everybody ive talked to has received one and i havent gotten mine i dont know well anyway Ellen it was nice talking to you you too and uh until next time okay goodbye ,taxes,2424
probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on uhhuh none at all huh right uh we used to have American Express and uh Visa that of course theres a yearly fee on i see yeah has it and we got rid of those we now have Discover we have a Visa that does not have a yearly fee and then we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we dont plan on keeping it the second year yeah that because im pretty frugal about things like that thats what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we dont have to pay a a fee at all and thats what i i know people who dont have any credit cards at all and im always amazed laughter because i dont know how they can get by without them it doesnt seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit laughtercard we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless youve left a credit card at the desk so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but yeah i like them  too with with us weve got insurance of course but due to my husbands work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice and then all the other the the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars laughteryeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i cant come up with laughteroh laughtermy can you do that on a credit card yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back oh for heaven sakes for the drugs yeah you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month laughterwhereas you know then i got to wait for the rest the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats you know during the the time because weve got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and thats usually enough time for the insurance to get back oh uhhuh i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i cant believe you know its like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good uh yes uhhuh uhhuh and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we cant use that one anymore well just get another one and thats like who you laughteri have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesnt know she has now uh she must rent a p post office box or something or i mean she couldnt beat him to the mail every month i wouldnt think because they both work and they uh hes a fireman so hes home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i dont know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it oh yeah but thats thats a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh thats just dishonest oh oh i would think so but theyve been married almost thirty five years so i think theyve done things laughterlike laughterthat laughterto laughtereach laughterother laughterfor laughtera laughterlong laughtertime oh well laughter laughtermaybe laughtermaybe laughtertheyll laughterbe laughterall laughterright i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would just be well i i think i would feel the same way id id really feel like id been deceived you know that that wasnt the thing to do yes yes well many many many many years ago uh i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen uh dining kitchen family room combination and i wanted to paper it  and i bought wallpaper from Sears catalog on my Sears card and at that time i was only able to pay about ten dollars a month which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off the balance by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so thats kind of been my motto yeah weve tried to do that weve paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before i i quit work two years ago to stay home with the kids and right and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in  uhhuh  but weve gone back the other way to some extent because because just because there are times when you just cant pay it all uhhuh uhhuh because there are just too many bills well as you say when youre taking children to the doctor and adults too it does make a difference our children are matured out of the home and uh our needs are much different than they were uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without one but uh we have a Discover card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those laughter oh isnt that silly i i sent that one back because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth during the year and what we and and i think we got back fifty cents or laughtersomething it was like please what is this this is and the interest rate on it was was eighteen or nineteen percent did you laughter laughteryeah laughteryeah and our Visa card was we could get through our credit union was like fourteen percent so we just we sent it back we we keep gas credit cards and we have Visa and then i have started my own business i have a photography business and i went ahead and got a separate Visa just for that photography business because there are things that i have to buy and and with my photography when i when i take things to the lab to get developed its several hundred dollars at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit with my photography business even though again its paying off every month because im im putting everything im im uh you know im getting the pictures and im taking them back to the people i already have their money but i wasnt depositing them until i gave them the pictures back another practice i found im going to have to stop hot checks laughter you wouldnt think for a for a twelve dollar school picture that uh that people would write a hot check but they do oh i laughtersee oh dear  well i think those are the same people who have their credit cards uh charged up to the max and thats just a way of life i guess i guess its just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee uhhuh uhhuh for a returned check so now shes already doubled the price of her check and ive sent it through a second time because they said theres money in the account now you know and and if it doesnt go through the second time that womans out thirty bucks for one twelve dollar check its never quite made sense to me but then uh for one twelve dollar check when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it laughtergosh laughter so  i dont know why he you know didnt go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but hes going to have a debt going out the ear vocalizednoise i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing laughter so weve we have a little problem with our gas card were uh weve always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh we its very difficult to find their stations so i guess thats one reason why we use uh weve used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even uh uhhuh  well we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now theyre charging the extra five cents to use your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else is not anymore theyll take it you know at the cash price or you theyll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month i thought that was illegal whats that writing a check for gas no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card well all of them down down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price oh so what theyre doing theyre discounting for cash is the way theyre because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so right thats thats supposedly thats that theyre looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but right and and theyve changed that now now baside stop it go play and leave me alone easide laughteryeah and so im using the other ones now because theyre just as easy to get to and then theyre nickel a gallon cheaper so umhum so what were saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if its going to cost us money we dont though laughter we laughtertry laughternot laughterto laughterwere laughterprobably laughterthe laughteronly laughtertwo laughterpeople laughterin laughterthe laughterUnited laughterStates laughterthe laughterbank the banks dont want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest and leave us laughter oh i guess they must they must make a ton vocalizednoise theres not too many places you can make eighteen percent interest on things anymore thats right thats right thats what we need see you and i need to get in the credit card business laughterwe laughterneed laughterto laughterstart laughterour laughterown laughtercredit laughtercard laughter laughterif laughteryou laughtercan laughteryeah because you sure cant get that interest anyway else gosh i guess so laughter that would be wonderful wouldnt it laughter huhuh huhuh not on those CDs were trying to live on laughter uh yeah oh yeah ours are like seven percent weve got one and with with IRA stuff in it and uh jeez you cant get any interest rates my folks have just retired just in the last couple of months my dad has and uh theyre trying to figure out you know what theyre doing with stuff and my moms in there cutting up the credit laughtercards laughter you know cant use these laughteranymore and sure sure yeah well like i say the only reason we do in fact i when my husband and i were vocalizednoise ,credit_card,2447
im not sure i even know where to begin on this mess oh it it is a mess laughter i do believe though a lot of speculative speculative buying and investment on speculation uh too many large deals with too much risk uh oh definitely umhum bad deals with friends laughter and and associates of friends and on it goes over a long period of time and i think yes uhhuh it i think its a a type of situation where okay the first investment didnt work but if we throw a little bit more money in on it maybe this one may you know and try to get our money back throw good money after bad you mean exactly exactly those you said its just not doesnt work laughter thats that is that is some of what some of what i had read is thats part of cause of it now as to the question of what to do about it oh heavens laughter i would uh it has to be government regulation oh yeah it but you know it its its i dont know laughter its not something i know a whole lot about but uh its such its such a big huge complicated mess laughter i dont either but the other thing this Dickson that they convicted he only got five years i know i couldnt believe it so thats going to leave a message to other people that yeah he can be out in twenty months they said well yes but hes in very poor health so you know twenty months may mean a lot longer for him but still yeah but yeah but still i i health and health and everything i mean if yeah its our money its our taxes that have to pay for this mess oh that well there are too i think theres too many savings and loans period theres you know you you drive down the street and theres one on every corner this is true this is very true and and it it i think its too easy to to uh form one that you know because i mean look look in Dallas theyre everywhere they were everywhere and then then they started being taken over by bigger bigger ones and then they just the bigger ones took on the little ones debt and then it it just snowballed and thats probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now yeah its it it theres just it just seemed like everybody and their brother had a savings and loan laughter this is a very true thing i didnt think about that part of it you know because you know i have never im uh were originally from Missouri and there are you know mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings and loans in the area i mean i have never seen so many as there are down here oh really thats interesting theyre theyre theyre just everywhere and and you know set up in trailers laughter i seen one on Preston Road that was set up in a trailer for a while before they built the little building oh yes yes this is true oh how funny and then uh and then uh it went out uh i mean i just wonder how much that cost us yeah and how many people lost money on that lost money in that thing but who but uh who knows its that is scary i didnt think about that well they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and millions a lot a lot better than they are have been Dickson is the only one i even heard of i mean there may be more that they are prosecuting but Dickson is the only one i even heard of they must be getting some on the national level i think ive read various things but i just no names come to mind because if he only stole six stole six hundred thousand dollars thats just a drop in the bucket compared to some of them that were were skimming millions yeah because thats a drop in the bucket to the taxes were going to have to pay to to make up for this yeah yeah because there are bigger fish i know i mean otherwise it wouldnt be in such a mess that the the stealing because uh stealing and leaving the country probably they cant they probably cant find them laughterwhat laughterthe laughterdeal laughteris laughter oh you know youve got a good point there but uh eventually you know the the tax money is getting extremely low on the FSLIC i mean theyre in theyre getting theyre getting so low it its almost in trouble and and wheres wheres that going to come from and the and the other thing is they said the insurance the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance oh yeah oh yeah laughter thats and thats frightening that is frightening because as another uh my car insurance is frightening right now i cannot believe how much money i pay oh oh our car insurance i cant either for for uh for nothing for almost nothing well and i just carry the absolute minimum required by law and im paying i mean every quarter im paying like five hundred dollars a year and that oh well you dont pay we we keep full coverage down here on everything because well its not its not that bad but thats getting off the subject laughter uh oh my but uh but the you think that they that they could come up with a better system of regulating these these little bitty uh savings and loans that uh well i you know the problem is who is they and you get they is the government the government yeah thats what i meant Congress but you get you get into when you start getting them to do things you get into a lot of special interest groups again yes exactly exactly and lobbying oh you know theres a big and you know and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people yeah thats true thats true thats what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person thats changing it they may put another loophole in that makes it even worse wasnt even there to begin with yeah and and and people like us never hear about about whats really going on and what they what theyre really doing and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because theyre there to sell newspapers thats the problem with the news both the on television and the paper television is worse television is worse well all theyre there to sell you know or to entertain even worse and uh not to transmit information uhhuh yeah thats yeah oh exactly what makes so what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to decide anything yeah yeah vocalizednoise we got these people up in Washington deciding all this stuff for us and we dont even know what theyre deciding so it its and whose best interests they represent us or someone else and how many of them were invested in just laughterhow laughtermany laughterof laughterthem laughterhave laughterinvested laughterin laughtera laughtersavings laughterand laughterloan in in a savings and loan laughter or own a or has a brother that owns yeah yeah oh yeah vocalizednoise its really a scary scary thing yeah but im its one of those one of those things that i just dont know where the answer lies its just its just its going to uh it it doesnt seem like its going as badly as it did in the past few years its kind of slow because the closings has kind of slowed a little bit well now there was an article in the paper this morning in the business section how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore oh really yeah when when you know when youre trying to buy a house how incredibly hard it is to get get a loan approved simply because theyre they are tightening down so much huh well i can see why i can see why i can see why because they were loan they were loaning money to everybody and anybody that i mean they didnt check up on people they were loaning people ungodly amounts of money that were that that that couldnt pay for it and you wonder how in the world these people got their loans why look at look at the i thirty condos i know somebody at TI that bought one of them things uh back when they first laughter opened uhhuh oh yes you know that big scam and they just they just left town they just they just packed up and left town smart move and i mean i mean they left well yes but no because they uh they left their loan hanging yes they they just oh did they thats not and that happened that happened a lot in this area people just packing up and leaving their houses and leaving the the banks and the savings and loans out to dry on the loans on the car on house loans but they are hurting their own credit that way hey i know people that it does they dont care it wouldnt i am extremely touchy vocalizednoise vocalizednoise picky about my credit rating but i know people that just dont care what they done bankruptcy means nothing to these people and it hurts all of us it when they declare bankruptcy its you and me that that have to pay for it and these people dont care oh absolutely yeah because they can you know they write all that and people that write things off as bad debt that lowers their threshold of income of what they have to pay taxes on which automatically automatically makes our taxes go up because there is so much that has to be paid oh yeah oh of course and if this guy is exempt from paying it we have to pay more thats exactly right so its just we got to take up slack and so its its its a lot of people just run running out on loans that they couldnt pay for in this area i mean you just cant imagine how many houses people just run have run out on yeah that is really sad i i know it i know it i dont think its its as bad now as it was a couple of years ago when everything just kind of fell apart you know everything just kind of fizzled what because when we moved down here in eighty three i mean there was buildings going up on every corner every week and laughter and and the unoccupied ,bank_bailout,2454
so uh describe your family budget well ive uh for a lot of years ive ive pretty much flied without one and uh just recently uh we we set up a budget and and were trying to stick to it we just bought a new house so weve got everything you know pretty much we know what our uh our fixed expenses are per month and then weve got some ones that are variable that that pretty much stay within a certain range and then uh then theres the ones that you never know anything about and thats the the food budget but that well yeah and to some extent uh utilities i imagine yeah well the utilities theyre pretty much uh uh you can pretty much uh figure what theyre going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where theyll average them out for you uh they have that to some extent here but its not quite as good and uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car yes sir and you know how much youre going to drive every week well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i i was very convenient i lived uh uh nine tenths of a mile from work so so was uh you know two miles a day laughter to and from work laughter so it it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now ive just bought a new house and im a half hour and so my uh transportation costs have uh gone up by uh five times laughter yeah i understand that we we have a real similar situation ours have uh quintupled at least uh so there is a real family budget yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money uh i have uh three children and uh it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house and i can remember years ago when uh school would start and id go buy all five kids you know shoes and i could get out of the out of the uh out of the shoe store with uh out spending more than thirty five dollars nowadays thirty five dollars buys about one pair of shoes if youre lucky laughteryeah so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years exempt or nonexempt im exempt wow must be nice part of the high price spread uh no uh well we dont we do but we dont have a family budget we have the fixed things that we have to pay we have the things that are extras but it seems that by and large the extras just dont exist well you know the auto budget the car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry and insurance is insurance bad there ive got uh two older cars there both uh ones a seventy seven and ones a seventy eight well weve got one eighty nine and uh my insurance is about uh it was running about four hundred dollars a year but when i moved to the new town i live in because its a different county which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so its a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance companys concerned so my my i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year wow thats thats not bad four hundred and something a year thats thats well its actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars so  thats cheaper than we pay yeah yeah i was down in Texas for uh two years and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance um they well here in Colorado its even worse because we have uh no fault do you have that there uh in Maryland they uh they have no fault in Maryland also well no faults rather funny in Colorado because uh it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays its kind of its kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no ones injured the police wont even show up youre kidding they tell you if nobodys injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company vocalizednoise well if you i dont know how familiar you are with Maryland but uh especially the the the center part of Maryland where i ninety five runs through it is really heavily populated not at all and theres just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic they dont even try to keep up with it God so you lived in Texas for a while not a bit yes sir i spent uh couple years down there moved down there in eighty seven and moved out in eighty nine are where you from originally uh right here in Maryland huh so you just basically went home when you had a chance and my family yeah my family uh didnt like Texas and i had a chance to uh transfer up TI bought a company about seven months after i moved to Texas right here in Hunt Valley uh thats nice so i got an opportunity to transfer back and i took it God thats great uh no im a native Texan west Texan there is a difference laughteryeah believe me i know there is i lived in Plano and i dont know if youre familiar with Plano but Plano maybe five percent of the people in Plano actually were from Texas everybody else was an import well im im a west Texan Lubbock Midland Odessa Amarillo Dumas Panhandle a different world from down there so uh Colorados been fun but they have a real problem next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile and every time you look at a look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains you got to throw in a dollar or or so it seems i i may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive yeah yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland but i noticed when i was in the in the in Texas they didnt have a state income tax but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and school taxes and property taxes yeah yeah property taxes and yeah well Colorado oh my God ate you alive you know they have the state income tax but then they also have property taxes and they also have sales taxes and they just and they just get you every direction they can and i just dont know sir but they it seems like they trying to get you every which way yeah it sure does um theres uh some good books that ive read um that you might be interested in um Charles D Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on late night TV and hes got seminars you can go to and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks oh yeah but hes got a couple of books out uh one of them is called um  Wealth Without Risk ive heard of the book yes its a very good book its tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do what to do with the money that you save legally cut money on your taxes huh yes  yes sir legally legally cut money on your taxes and on your uh insurance and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to uh uh  you know be wealthier uh he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and havent had a chance to uh to crack it open yet um  Financial Self Defense i believe is the name of it uh the man uh has a lot of good ideas some of them i already knew about some of them i had already practiced but uh i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because uh and that includes everyone at TI laughteryes yes im one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety one yes well even the you know the non exempts technically yet we havent had our salary frozen but when youre only at living wage it doesnt matter you know survival is a funny state yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in Dallas i was supervisor and i had uh four non exempts um under me and uh i i was appalled at what the hell they were paying them i just couldnt believe it did well ive been with the company sixteen years now i was a WF for several years it just never never seems to improve it and it doesnt seem to get much better for the exempts either unless youre twenty eight or above its really a shame well i ive this company that they bought they ended up buying a very high payroll and uh the you know uh i thought i was making a good wage you know high wage till i came ,family_finance,2467
Colorado Springs oh right up in uh TI out there oh right did you hit one yeah i just hit one then all right the savings and loan scandal it i i got to uh this is going to be fun are you Republican or Democrat kind of neither okay well i was i was im a Democrat so i was going to say if youre a Republican boy we would really have a good time i do have some Republican leanings because i am division one you know laughter well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money and theyre the ones wasting all the money and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know i get a kick out of that but anyway the subject go ahead you first uh i think its a stinking shame that that there isnt capital punishment for those assholes that stole our money yeah i uh i dont think its over i think that uh so many other things have taken over uh in the media but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know i agree with you i think it had something to do with deregulation but i believe uh more of it was just greed yeah i was talking to someone i cant remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and uh yeah there there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as im concerned not just a couple you know weve watched and watched TV and seen that a lot of these people were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit but financing the same property three and four times you know and the list goes on and on well i i agree a hundred percent you know of of just the crimes committed oh yeah much less for criminals that should be indicted it may have started with HUD too i noticed that HUD was in terrible shape and that was property and uh they lost a lot of money there and then some of these big these rich people started to even uh Murchison here who owned the Cowboys had a lot of property down in Florida this was several years ago and he lost you know all all of his money before he died not all of it i dont know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would vocalizednoise it always would increase you know it always would uh uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all yeah it everyone forgets whose money it was and everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word as far as being a Republican or a Democrat i think no American could stand for criminal action well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all uh Reaganomics for you know you spend your way to prosperity and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought thats not going to work you know and i knew that it wasnt going to work originally and it hasnt worked now you know in theory in theory a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on right no doubt no doubt if people are making money people can spend money and itll generate taxes oh yeah i i i agree with that but theres got to be some control and apparently there was you know well the problem is and the problem with Reaganomics is the people at the top are the ones getting rich for what they would cost and we werent producing anything we as Americans werent producing anything it was all inflation and im sorry we dont get into a real argument over it we agree too closely but yeah i know uh laughter laughter but you you cant say that that was right oh no i no intelligent person can say we could spend our way rich remember all were doing is delivering pizzas to each other and and not high quality ones at that you know yeah well well i do have a lot of confidence in the the American people and the economy and everything else i i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at TI you know and i think that the it it still a lot of the workers dont understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know it is a life and death struggle with Japanese with the Japanese i i know and and i when i of course im in facilities and i work with a lot of mechanics and i just cannot understand why theyre just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well im paid anyway so it doesnt matter you know i im very tired of it all pays by the hour right right and im nonexempt yeah oh really you dont sound like a nonexempt Jim is so you dont sound like a nonexempt what what does a nonexempt sound like uh youre too informed theyre theyre very theyre very uh not interested they wouldnt even talk probably about some of the things were talking about now i guess im dealing with too many Texas mechanics here i dont know really im im being a Yankee i guess im im letting my Yankee come out you know uh thats well i now maybe im not the uh typical nonexempt that you deal with the badge is silver and uh i am degreed though nonexempt uh well thats good no laughter thats not laughtergood but no right i mean thats good that youre degreed uh uh your time will come there we uh i know a few people that would no i i do not wish my time to come oh really what are you in a tech like do you do technician technician work or something or oh no no i government tool control is my specialty now i did PC protection control work for uh oh quality okay ten or twelve years uh right now im just trying to tool crib and hauling chips times are bad oh yeah well now is is uh really terrible i im uh management level uh facilities and when the cuts came three of us got uh bounced back and so were just uh im calling you from work i i i im im covering uh weekends and nights now im im one of the manager reps theres three of us to cover in Dallas facilities and just were essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends thats my i only get one weekend off a month right now i call it my recession job laughter its uh being vocalizednoise basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well theres not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on they turned all installation up here off they told facilities they could not work i dont care what the jobs are you will not work yeah it it and and as far as our you know our conversation goes i would really be interested to know how much of TIs problems now are related to the banking structure i think that not not only TI but a lot of it when they talk about uh there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i i have to admit im not as informed uh that much but theres something like eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well if they claim that its going to cost us eighty six billion its got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if thats true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere it really hurts me yeah its amazing really its amazing that to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values oh yeah i know what you mean uh one of our course your value of homes up there are pretty good i mean here theyre not really that high but are they pretty good up there oh really our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart well were in the metroplex here you know and uh it it i die every time companies like General Dynamics they they lost several contracts and and i dont know if you noticed yesterday you probably dont pay attention to the Bell Helicopter you know they were going to have this big uh award and Secorski got it which was Boeing Secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know yeah its northwest Seattle Seattle and also uh they do some of that in Wichita Kansas and i dont know how Bell didnt get it well i i dont i they were advertising here that it was Bell TI TI was getting the uh electronics with Bell and so it was a double one that Bell is in the Metroplex and two that TI was doing the electronics for them and they they uh advertised that that it was TI Bell TI Bell and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah Secorski Boeing Boeing doesnt need the money Secorski Boeing something i almost think theres some politics around here because the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the uh with TI i dont know if TI has lost as much as everybody else but General Dynamics and LTV and Bell have lost project after project you know well you realize ,bank_bailout,2478
you can go ahead and start if you want uh well um the budgets an interesting issue uh particularly since im pretty much a libertarian and an anachro libertarian at that uh so i would basically say the way to fix the budget is to uh cut and eliminate taxes charge user fees for things that uh are absolutely necessary and to be allocated fairly that way and um id say ninety percent of the budget has no business being there  i can agree with that and uh i know one thing we we need to do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because thats whats really  hurting everybodys goat  yeah i think i think a lot of people fail to realize but you know the government doesnt generate money you know they may print it but thats not really the way money is made its its made from people working and doing things that are productive and governments the net cost and government doesnt produce anything thats right so uh a dollar tax isnt isnt a dollar that can be you know that that makes more bread or anything else its uh its lost correct that uh i guess the uh the big thing about that is the fact that theyre spending someone elses money its not like its theyre out of their own savings account and thats another quagmire that really hurts us yeah i mean its its real easy when you go home and and you think gee you know id like to have a mansion and a yacht isnt it nice i can make my neighbors pay for it but but uh you know i mean the real world doesnt work like that or at least it shouldnt but it seems to in government isnt the basic needs of the government in the first place is to protect and what is the other one basic services is to protect and i dont know about providing all the other services that they do i mean even i i guess the uh the latest uh fire they came under was whenever they were providing a uh a tribute to um Lawrence Welk hum oh thats right contributing five hundred thousand to thats right restoration to his home i think that was called back because of all the flack they received but but thats the another one of the big examples of why were in such dilemma uhhuh well even just the general funding for the arts uh in humanities and then you know they get into these censorship issues and everything else i mean the arts in humanity should be privately funded i agree um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean thats why theyre things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldnt be a government responsibility but the government i think is supposed to be doing is is defending our rights no more and no less and the power given to the IRS is just astronomical and oh yeah thats awful when you sign your ten forty form youre signing a away youre rights i mean your your rights to uh uh protect yourself and that shouldnt be that way either uh the power given to those people is just well beyond it should be and uh the really what given it was given to them by Congress but Congress never really had the right to give it to them is the is the real argument um yeah its its so i dont know i mean so it i mean getting back to the budget its i guess the the fundamental thing is to give people a concrete get people to agree on a concrete idea of just exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them no more no less and cut government back down to that size its its its an enormous  enormous bureaucracy though its going to take probably years to really get that in to order too because everybody will want that pet project oh sure and and theres going to be a lot of you know cover your ass and you know well you can cut his program but not mine and and entrenched bureaucrats that dont want to loose their jobs and all the uh unnecessary military installations yep yep will have to be probably scrapped but thats going to be difficult we may we may need a constitutional convention really the biggest way uh probably will its the only way its going to change is for us to have a better budget for running this country is for everybody to get involved and right now i dont see that happening not at the moment or not at this short time period laughter right i agree so my you have some pretty good ideas there well its been nice talking to somebody with who uh basically agrees with me yeah well im um i voted libertarian this last election i mean in most uh did you some of the boxes you know im really am interested in getting most of the incumbents out yeah absolutely i think the republic rats have uh driven this country downhill for too long yeah well all parties too are responsible its not just one particular one right thats why i said republic rat oh i see i see yeah laughter well now that we have aired our views in such an open way well it was good talking to you you too have fun up there you too hope to talk to you again maybe okeydoke byebye ,budget,2498
how do you uh manage your budget well lets see we or i sit down at the uh in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget for every two weeks and i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out and then i compare that to uh how much money we need to make and then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over well uh you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something and were going to try to start saving as soon as we can we generally dont have a lot left over but as far as the long term our longterm goal is to to get out of debt and uh most most of our debts are from before we were married and were trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things well i in my younger years id always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house and ive got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now and uh the uh improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate ive expected so were still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we havent gotten out from under them yet but uh so far weve managed to hold our own by uh trying to set up a a monthly budget uh i try to take out just so much cash for me and my uh give so much cash to my wife to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car and then the rest of its uh pretty much fixed expenses uh mortgage electricity uh water and uh and garbage collection and telephone laughterbills and cable television bills and those are pretty much fixed yeah yeah thats basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and you know those kinds of things uh we dont have a lot of uh you know like JC Pennys in our laughter in our budget and uh maybe twice a year were to where i can let my wife go clothes shopping like that and lets see my motherinlaw lives uh not too far from here so she helps with our sons clothes when she can thats real good and uh well at TI i have a real good uh benefits package for uh you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so thats not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously yeah no my wifes pretty good about uh grocery shopping and she pitches in and uh makes clothes for the kids really well thats neat uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items like this month the uh heat pump went out and uh  um yeah they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that so what do you do well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that well thats good that you have the savings to get into then maybe well go for a week or two and or a month or two and then the car laughterbreaks laughterdown laughter so its the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget yeah thats thats the way we are weve had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh couple months that uh really hit us hard but ive been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses so but weve never been weve been married for uh nearly four years and weve never been able to save any money and i think its just hit both of us uh just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it even if its you know ten dollars a week and so were going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision well do you have some uh savings plans at work no actually im im not involved in anything like that at work or uh anywhere uh i dont have anything to fall back on at all and i i know thats not wise but thats just uh where were at right now my wife just went back to work parttime uh she can substitute teach at schools and uh theres so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work you know everyday but were were just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and were just going to apply all the money that she makes to uh uh our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast as we can and theres and were were Christians and thats uh weve only been Christians for about five years but thats a a real a biblical truth in the Bible is to to not be in debt and were laughterreally starting to see the the the reasoning behind that and uh because were you know were always well i cant be laughtersick this week but one day or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am or you know i cant we cant go on a two week vacation because uh i wouldnt make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all the time and you know we we really see how were you know indebted or nearly underneath uh the debt that we have you know and thats thats really hard but so far weve never really uh been behind on any bills uh i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months and we had a a cutback at work and uh this is this was a couple of years back but anyway but were doing really good were not saving but were staying right even yeah well weve been looking around at uh uh trying to develop some side activities that that might help out such as uh creating some craft objects that we can market in the uh local stores oh yeah or uh uh making uh some dresses for children or things like that or even writing childrens laughterbooks yeah thats neat oh thats neat yeah and uh i tried uh this past year writing uh journal articles but uh i found out it cost me more than the the honorariums i got for writing them oh wow because of the time uh well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of laughterreprints for laughterhandouts and i ate up all my laughterprofits with uh buying reprints yeah my my wife made uh a whole lot of crafts last year for Christmas presents and we didnt uh you know have to allot any well hardly very very much money anyway for Christmas just for our uh personal family just me and her and our son and i think her mom and that was really you know about it we we made everything else that uh we gave for Christmas last year and she did really good with that oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with Christmas this past year but uh we have a family dog that uh ate all of the childrens toys laughterso laughtercoming laughterup laughterto laughterChristmas laughtertime laughter the girls didnt have any toys laughterso we had to go out and oh wow oh no and get them a whole new set of playthings now i dont know how the dog has fared eating all that plastic and uh and stuffed animal stuffing but laughter hes still here laughter wow wow thats pretty laughterpretty laughterbizarre laughter the dog ate the Christmas presents thats funny well anyway what uh is the economy doing pretty good there where youre at so far its uh doing fairly well uh were in the metropolitan Washington area and uh i guess most of the area is still living off the federal government with uh beltway bandit type contracts uh our company is uh done fairly well and uh yeah what company is it im with the Melpar division of ESystems oh of ESystems okay i see what do you all make uh were primarily in the uh uh systems integrations business selling to the government ,family_finance,2508
hi Maureen how are you all right well do you have a family budget no we probably should but we havent so why dont you explain to me some good tips about what youve done which youve found useful and workable okay we do a few things and i have to say were my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds i im an accountant and uh he has an MBA so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that laughterso um um okay coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget  excuse me for instance i control all the household expenses the groceries the um haircuts the gasoline for my car any miscellaneous expenses babysitting things like that and uh  excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and i dont have any money uh laughter we dont buy any more laughtermilk laughterfor laughterinstance but uh weve gotten pretty good at it weve been doing it for a couple of years now so we our budgets are realistic and they are not so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable uh and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sams and things like that but uh we live we live on a on a cash budget and it it sometimes its tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it what do you do for the surprise things that you dont necessarily plan for the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that youre not prepared for well uh most of our medical things we dont uh have to worry about because of insurance and theyre theyre relatively small uh weve been lucky in the past we didnt have that problem but right now we dont for the other things the things that do crop up that we arent really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not  so i mean and im i vocalizednoise i cant really remember what it is now do you kind of continue call this like vocalizednoise a part of savings account or a different savings account um its all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know lets say its a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund you know laughter ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever uh and we just we constantly do that so that theres a build up of money for those things and if something does come up like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day and oh okay so but we have the money set aside so if it does its not going to kill us uh so were were actually were pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through then some like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses kind of thing well in our or like what what percent do you then save or something uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent of our um of our pay hm okay it and it goes toward different things its for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so laughter were starting our kids a little bit laughterearly do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things checking account a lot  uh not so much credit cards now several years back i used to use charge uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well its on sale you know it must be a good deal and there have been times that i have been bad about the credit cards and so pretty much now uh we dont use them too much if we travel or something yeah but you know standard we usually dont or if it it is a purchase uh then its paid off when the bill comes you know so it isnt any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the uh store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so its not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all right thats good and but that hasnt always been the case laughter so im kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh you know in the past and i dont have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer oh and its not deductible anymore laughter laughter yeah well ive never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow but uh or you can deduct it anyway yeah but pretty much when i always i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didnt have enough money when things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget vocalizednoise well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have i dont even remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month lets say and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and some months it may be different its not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you dont really have much control over the cash budget just fits right in there and laughter like i said if we dont have we we also set aside money for entertainment i mean its but again its a set amount every month and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we we dont we we you know we still have fun on laughterthings okay uh were in the process of trying to buy a house do you know how did your budget work or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didnt have to put down anything so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house oh okay so we we got out of that one pretty easily laughter uh yeah i i just keep thinking all the time i mean it its really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then its awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime sure i know thats how i feel about sometimes about my kids education i mean jeez they are one and four laughter we have got a long time to save up my husband hes the real hes the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually oh no no laughter well i know but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make X amount of money and where is it i mean you look around and you go where is it you you you havent made uh big purchases and thats the easier thing to see if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the TV or something like that what do you do with it i know uhhuh right but all those you know just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and theres big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff that you dont have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things thats gone used and gone oh yeah yeah its its amazing how much we spend on some things my husband cut him self down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work and thats all he has he has a ten dollar bill and i mean so id say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch the other times hell uh i dont know go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever uhhuh uhhuh but but he keeps himself on that i mean he found i mean its so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch thats a hundred dollars a month thats thats twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch laughter when he can take a sandwich you laughterknow ,family_finance,2515
okay uh i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didnt buy so much stuff overseas well i dont know how much that would do for the budget though i mean that has helped the economy as a whole you know American jobs and all but well then maybe they wouldnt have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that yeah if we bought more American stuff i guess thats more American taxes well i guess you know its like your own home budget you know you can either earn more money or you can uh spend less and you know just like you and i have to make choices like that i think the government has to do it too well i agree i think thats what im trying to laughtersay yeah the question is which which  excuse me thats my little girl which one should they do spend less i think we vocalizednoise well i think we give too much money away other countries yeah to other countries we dont ever get anything from anybody when were having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in  well thats thats the thats because were supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away right well its not true though were not anymore vocalizednoise were still we are still the biggest ones as you know as far as how much money weve got in the whole country were still bigger than anybody else we cant even take care of the people that are hungry and homeless here yeah thats thats an important thing weve got weve got a lot of people who are getting money the from the government for this that and the other thing uh i mean and uh it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and theyre paying income taxes all of a sudden youve changed it around and its going in the other direction but see right right now were having a hard time finding people jobs if youre a TI worker you how well you know are you are you a TI worker yeah so am i  so we know you know that times are really tough right now and yet were still sending money here and there i just know it yes i am you know its just crazy and more and more people without i have several friends without jobs now that in this last riff went out looking for jobs and jobs are really hard to come by now really hard to come by yeah thats what i dont understand and thats scary yeah you wonder you know when is it going to happen to me thats right its already happened to me once but i was lucky and i got to stay in TI but you know not everybodys that lucky anymore and theyre and i dont know the welfare system is just so abused well i i i dont think the problem so much is abuse i think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too much um i mean who where does it say that the governments supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera and and where does it say that that if someone is short that they can go to the government and and get a handout well i know but then okay but thats here but then other countries are doing it to us their when their people are hungry and all theyre asking us for handouts so why shouldnt our own people be able to ask for a handout i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing but i just dont i think were and then they keep raising the taxes boy ill tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and wages arent going up that laughtermuch and its hard no theyre not i mean you know especially if youre alone its on one salary its terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous you know  and you know i think you know ive got a fairly decent job here at TI but uh when i think of you you go to the the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think you you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by not very much because i know how hard it is for me to get by yep its hard its really hard i well uh no i dont know i guess if we had the answers wed we could save the country but we could go run for office yeah laughter well they all say great things when they run for office well the thing is um you know whos really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent and and its you know its not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the Congress and you know what the Congress is out for theyre theyre going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area and uh uh and that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobodys working on less money going to his area or on anybody elses area and if you just if you just looked at how much Congress spends on itself its ridiculous yeah i know that you know and then they cut their defense i im not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really laughterbad laughteri just i hated to see that well now the thing is yeah theyre cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i dont i dont mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job Government the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to to do that but i dont want them to to break the budget just so that i can have a job  i would rather have the the government stable so that i can go get a good job with someone whos not working you know not making defense stuff well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it laughter i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because if you know what i mean Reagan was so defense conscious and we were doing so well and i thought well Bush is going to just carry right on laughter he didnt laughter was i laughtersurprised i uh well he didnt have much choice really well i dont know but but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social Security and uh  but those are things that we we really need i hate to see the old people that dont have anybody and hey you know there are  people out there that have no family or and they really depend on their Medicare and their Social Security and maybe theyre in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them yeah well you know how fast your TI medical insurance has been going up right yeah laughter well just think the federal governments insurance bill has Medicare and thats been going through the roof and thats why federal you know thats thats the biggest increase in federal spending right there so whats the answer think we need to figure out a way to uh to make medical care cheaper why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast you know because its its coming out of my paycheck its coming out of your paycheck and its coming out of our taxes too yes yeah why why is these hospitals making so much money isnt it England that has it all state run or something oh theres a whole lot of countries in Europe that do that Sweden Denmark Norway they what is it is it free to the people to people or how do they work that its its free for everybody in the state or the country everybody in the country like i i lived in Denmark for a couple of years and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and theyll help you theres couple of things though first of all its not as high a quality as we expect here because its paid for by the government instead of by us and second um your taxes are a lot higher oh okay an awful lot higher were talking fifty percent something like that so they are paying for it okay well the way i you know it was talked about they are paying for it and and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either well then thats not the answer there has got to be a middle ground i think Canadas got a good answer but i dont know many details about it what do they do its its some sort of government program ive heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just dont know the details on it oh okay i dont know i dont know if anything will ever happen to to change change change things i i guess its going to have to change well somethings going to have to change but you look at the Congress and you look how many of them get reelected and theyre the ones that have got to make the changes i mean i dont see anything changing because youve got the same old people in there and the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance now i dont know how much longer im going to be able to afford it at all its eating me alive because i i might be almost fifty but im single and laughteri laughterdont laughterthink and this companys that just because and i own my own home and i have a garage laughter and because im single theres companies that wont take me no matter how old you are they wont take you because they say youre a risk you go out and party i said i dont even drink i mean i dont even go out but they wont take you i mean i was turned down this year by an agent who represented im not sure of the companies he represented but i was told because youre single they absolutely wont take you i said that is thats prejudicial thats terrible whats going to happen if they all start doing this umhum whats really terrible is they can do this to you you know and you dont really have that much of a choice as to whether or not you take it because the government government says if youre going to drive a car youve got to have the insurance but yet theyre not helping us with the companies theyre theyre not helping you uh be able to afford the insurance that theyre making you buy thats right ,budget,2522
well how do you use your credit cards i use them carefully i guess um i uh i usually dont i usually use them to consolidate billing uh for convenience sakes but i usually just pay them off at the end of the month yeah especially what i do i dont i dont avoid the finance charges uh as high as they are i dont uh ridiculously high you know i dont let them carry over you know i uh ive been lucky i guess i havent had a bill big enough where i couldnt pay them off at the end of the month but i i try to try to live within a budget you know and so well so i keep that in mind i just dont you know i guess it takes selfrestraint when you have a credit card to know that that theres really you really have to pay these things laughteroff yeah plus a lot more laughter plus a lot more you know and you got to realize that theres only this much money in the bank and if youre going to live you know yeah well if youre not going to try to you know say well ill pay it off sometime in the future yeah for so many years i was so deep in debt on credit cards and i finally dug my way out of them and that was enough to teach me you know you just laughter i can do without them right vocalizednoise some people have a rip theirs up just because they cant you know they cant resist them i got rid of a lot of them especially the ones where i paid fees uh i kept the ones that were free and basically the same thing i use them if im running short of cash and theres something i want or sale a sale or when i travel i use them i use them to float sometimes if its near the end of the month and you know and you know i dont have a check coming in a few days yeah yeah yeah its about ill go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there yeah thats what i do by the time the bill comes yeah if theres running into a cash short or something theres some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card uhhuh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times i dont like to carry a lot of cash with me vocalizednoise i have so i just carry my credit card and and for things like that as long as i know you know that im im not over doing it laughter its a and yeah i have i have what i have two credit cards thats all i use im always getting stuff in the mail all the time yeah yeah i you are a preferred such and such and you are yeah youre youre already approved then its back youre already approved to get i uh for the longest time i id gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months but uh sometimes they just send them to you and say here have a credit card laughter i have that one oh do you yeah yeah i just ripped i just cut it up and threw it away but you know vocalizednoise oh you should have used it you wouldnt have been liable for the payment is that right huh i didnt know that they yeah they send you card that that you didnt want that you didnt apply for its yours is that right of course they could always stick something in the credit bureau laughter thats right thats right they could they can make your life miserable if they want to sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago is that right uh and i i tore up their card and sent it to them and now ive got another one laughter we dont have too many Exxon stations out this way oh really what do you got out there uh weve got lots of Mobil Mobils yeah Mobils are big and we have a few Exxon weve got some other ones like Citgo yeah is a is a one yeah well i dont think i dont think weve got a Citgo here in Raleigh no matter of fact i know we dont got some Shell stations a few Texaco stations we have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas but theyre not Citgo stations i guess the biggies around here are Exxon Texaco and um well gosh thats about it BP i guess and theres another local one i cant i cant remember what theres some few Sinclair stations gosh i havent seen a Sinclair station in years yeah the few theyre the green dinosaurs are their their gosh there used to when i was a when i was a kid there was a Sinclair station about three blocks away thats where i used to go to pump up my tires and get my flats fixed and all of that vocalizednoise  logo yeah theres not that many down here that you know once once in a while youll see one i guess theyre still in business just barely i guess well just you ever you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they theyve charged charged you for something you didnt didnt no uh i ive nope ive never had that didnt purchase i i did have a problem with American Express one time about ten years ago when i first got started in a business um yeah i have they got my name of course and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them saying you havent paid youre overdue pay it so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call from someone saying say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing and i said what are you talking about ive already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check so they said okay well take care of it two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else and never heard from them uhhuh somebody blew it but i just yeah i just you know i aint got time to mess mess around with them too many people want my money out there i dont have to pay somebody to take it do you have the Discover card no i dont i i kept wanting i kept thinking about getting it but i just dont use the things enough to justify getting it either either do i they they i dont know i dont know how anybody can fall into this you get cash back and buy into that because all theyre giving you back is a little bit of the interest you paid in thats right thats thats right youre paying youre paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it yeah their interest right their interest rates twenty two percent higher than any other ones and then they said that well give you back some of your money hum thats right laughteryeah right and in the meantime for that entire year theyve got the use of that money uh like uh yeah its it its a ripoff oh it is i theres so vocalizednoise but a lot of people think its wonderful i guess said theyre theyre doing well everything ive read theyve been getting a more market share i guess theyre theyre advertising and promotions and well vocalizednoise uh Americas Americans are suckers yeah i guess so i dont know they dont know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this ones twenty two hum yeah i have a on my credit cards i have a grace period if i pay it off within when the bill comes i i dont have to owe any interest yeah i yeah right thats and uh ive only got ive only got two uh two cards now ive got a Bank of Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard and and thats it i mean i i dont need anything else now umhum  yeah once in a while uh my i have an American Express they have this vocalizednoise a buyer protection thing where you they extend the warranty so uh they both can be nice around Christmas time and stuff if youre going to buy a TV or uh or uh vocalizednoise electronic yeah something something like that my roommate really believes in American Express hes got the green card or the gold card and the the Optima card and and everything huh he just he just thinks theyre terrific and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card well if you have the money i guess laughter laughteryeah laughterim im thinking myself get what you pay for huh really yeah you know hes hes impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess its every year they itemize all your purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that uh yeah its a nice report but is it worth you know is it worth sixty bucks a year vocalizednoise for that little for that laughterreport dont be crazy uh when i was over in England i picked i picked up that uh Bank of Scotland Visa card and i i dont know hardly i dont ever use it except when i want to play the currency market um thats thats when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things for what im getting and then if if i think the rates going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars and it its worked out most of the times im im usually pretty good on calling the the currency market uhhuh yeah a lot of people do that for a living i guess trade trade money yeah i i did it  when i lived over there i did it quite often um and i really i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states and the bank that i banked with i could write them a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for it and and i and over and over the course of a year i i figured out how long it took them to clear that check and the and the shortest period of time was eight days so generally about eight days before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying id id start cashing in my checks for pounds and then by the time the other check went through it the it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and it it was great i mean i i could made a little extra money there huh yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get ,credit_card,2536
the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh a bit of a system whereby the the natural human greed was able to flourish and some people were able to do some things that that uh they they felt that that since the government was backing them they could just uh go ahead and make these transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were and it was rather difficult to catch all if if any of the people that were really responsible for it and even those who were caught didnt seem to get get much in the way of punishment as far as getting a restitution made so it just seems like a a really set up you know the whole thing was set up to to be abused and so human nature did so yeah i think the oh yeah yeah i think the government is its own worst enemy about the time it was all going on they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to stimulate the economy and plus they had cut back on the way of government regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry and uh i think the whole economic situation was set up to uh put the savings and loans in the position they were in and they mainly the banks too uh economically we had gotten into pretty unsound conditions and so the idea of trying to make the money supply good and loose via whatever medium whether it be savings and loans or banks either one was the order of the day  so needless to say they did and uh since they didnt really regulate it well or watch it well uh by cutting back on uh government uh uh uh monitoring in that respect then it did get out of hand and youre right youre absolutely right there were some people who saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it and uh because of it you and i are the main taxpayers now are going to have to pay not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made but were going to have to pay for the uh mistakes in the uh uh taking advantage of the system to some of these well really when you get right down to it crooks uh uh took advantage of the system with and yeah theyve seem to caught a few i ive heard on TV or read in uh the newspaper about a couple of these guys i forget the the name of one of them but i heard that they did uh  prosecute him and maybe a couple of others i think you all had a major crisis down there in Texas right yeah there were quite a few down here mainly by just because of the sheer numbers that were here as of you know the and the chances of getting a bad one would be greater just out of the sheer population of them being here and the whole problem seemed to start start toward uh not that California was the instigator of it but it seemed to start out that way and then then work its way here and it wasnt kind of funny that it wasnt a national problem until it hit the east coast yeah thats always interesting isnt it see hes right you laughterknow when it started hitting the big New York banks and the up then it became a nationwide problem and Congress got to do something but oh yeah uh Texas is on basically on the way to recovery as far as uh the banking industry goes and they oh im glad to hear that because ive been concerned that the banks may be going the same direction that the savings and loans primarily because uh what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things thats beginning to get the banks in trouble  and that was uh the real estate uh backing in investment and just building in general backing contractors and those kinds of uh corporations uh who were trying to build a lot of uh uh rental business space and uh mall type space and things like that and uh it looked like in the seventies that that was going to be a real booming thing uh a infinitum i guess and uh anybody if they just stop and use a little common sense would realize well you just cant soak up this much real estate uh and continue to have this kind of growth indefinitely i mean you you its its like anything eventually reach sort of a plateau where youve overbuilt if youre not careful uh and uh it its as if uh they they went crazy just just like in gambling almost and there there was no regulation or anything like that uh i i frankly though and and im glad to hear you say what you said about Texas because i have been concerned that the banking system uh which is going through some economic difficulty now and with all the foreign investments that they uh put money into also  i ive ive been concerned that the banking system is going to find itself in dire straits or if they even didnt find themselves in dire straits were going to find ourselves with so much of our money uh lent out to foreign owners who are willing to soak up some of this this uh capital to keep us afloat you might say hoping to make a buck off of us in interest in the future that uh we find our own economic economy even though it may not have slipped into so so some kind of either deflationary or inflationary depression uh we find ourselves having sold out our futures in terms of what we are going to have to pay off all this debt with to foreign investors who have the money to build to buy up all the debt and uh im glad to hear that you do you know uh how uh theyre beginning to get over the feet in Texas are are is a lot of the money in loans and and the like that uh uh is that being covered by foreign investments maybe or or uh well part of the problem as i see it uh my familys involved in laughter in both industries as it were ive ive got a grandfather that was in the umhum umhum S and L back in the sixties and the seventies and in another part of Texas and in a uh immediate parents were both in banking as it were and so uh weve weve kept up with the industry as it were and the the feeling has been in some of the discussions that that get started on that topic has been that you know we went through the the bad times of a number of bad loans and fortunately the the banks and the S and Ls that uh our family were associated with really didnt have that much problem they were fairly conservative and they just had to ride out the storm with the the reputational problems that came with the the news media as it were and there were a number of banks that made the bad loans and basically its been a good weeding out process theres just been a lot of people a lot of banks a lot of whole organizations that were going to make these kinds of loans and they are no longer in business uh so you know you you have some all your bank failures that the governments having to take over you know thats gone up in the hundred and twenty or thirty or so for the state yeah its been quite a few every year yeah and thats pretty well leveled off and and the thats well do you think maybe its peaked you think yeah yeah yeah i dont think theres going to be that many more of them i i would so you you you you would uh predict based on at least your knowledge and experience that in time well see the numbers of banks and maybe savings and loans too if theyre still failing that that that the the number beginning to sort of taper off now instead of a hundred to two hundred a year you begin to see it go down to maybe fifty to a hundred a year and maybe right right theres just not that many more what kind of vocalizednoise time frame frame would you guess thats going to take to wring itself out well its hard to say how many more bad bad systems or bad apples there are out in the system but i would id be willing to bet that uh it shouldnt be more than a couple more years that that oh you think two years i i would have guessed five to ten but you really think two years well the as far as as far as not having this getting over this peak as it is now uh theres still going to be an unusual uhhuh uhhuh you know it depends on how far back you want to go lets say if you went back ten years and said heres a failure rate we could live with well then it may take us three to five years to get back to that level of failure oh okay but if you want to just say were over the hump and were starting to get better i think in a couple of years itll be quite obvious that were over the hump and getting better well tell me well all this all these bad loans and debts that uh i i know in the case of the savings and loans were just going to have to pick it up as American taxpayer but even the banks and the likes some so some of those are merging and uh uh the the the the basic question im trying get to is all this bad money thats essentially not going to get paid back hows it going to get covered im not sure if uh i mean is inflation going to make some of it go away and the rest of it were going to pick up the tab as taxpayers or are we going to be able to sell some of these bad loans or pick them up somehow or another uh uh by foreign investors uh buying pieces of our our economy like buying some of our been to some of our banks uh like the things that uh i forget the guys name downtown here uh was involved in uh those two banks i think that was in Georgia or someplace uh what what what how do see that this this indebtedness of which is bad loans and the like just not going to get paid back at least by the people who caused the debt uh you you cant just write that off completely you can write off a certain part of it i guess but you just cant just write off the whole somewhere along the line youve got to recoup some of that money some of the even if its twenty five to fifty cents on the dollar how how hows that going to happen well like one guy i heard just talking earlier this week on the topic was saying that that there wasnt any one given uh you know sort of like a uh suit guy making a uh suit for you it its custom made to the individual situation if you you dont try to find well write off all these to the government or have have the the entire uh bank failure covered by the government so you you take each individual situation yeah and if you can find a foreign investor or if you can find any investor thatll thatll finance i guess thats what the majority of the uh RTC is doing is trying to to resolve all these individual cases in any way possible i mean theyre looking for how good a job do you think theyre doing because you know theres been quite a bit in the various news magazines up here and even the Washington Post and various places about uh how they felt that the uh the people on the committee were sort of selling out at uh exorbitantly exorbitantly low prices to some rather astute investors some of this had been misinterpreted who were tending the who were really tend to make the nice killing off that how do you how do you feel about that well i was i was talking with another gentleman about that same topic its hard to get a feel for whats going on in a nationwide uh system like that when the news media reports the segments that they report you know you hear yeah mainly they look for the the wild news yeah you hear things like uh the ,bank_bailout,2591
so what are the benefits working for a large organization gosh i wouldnt know ive never worked for a large organization that will make it interesting well i will take that back i i was in the Air Force for thirteen years i guess that qualifies as a large organization yeah i i would qualify the U S government as large if not too large sort of large yeah just a little bit little bit bigger than TI yeah yeah okay oh some of the benefits i see i i never really counted that as an organization because its uh the benefits are funny yeah the benefits are strange they change every day and uh you dont really have a lot of choice laughter not like TI do you want this or do you want this or do you want this vocalizednoise well we dont have that kind of choice either oh i mean you certain yeah out here in the real world its a lot its all the same oh really no matter who your employer is no i mean you have the choice of taking this health insurance or some other or something like that here in the Springs we have a choice of two either an HMO or a company health insurance so there are two of course i cant say we didnt have a choice if you always wanted to you could uh go out and buy your health insurance and out of your own jeans yes yeah out of your own jeans and stay a way from the base hospital which is generally what i did kind of scary it was that bad huh uh i i never fully trusted them the only time i ever went there was when i had to for a flight physical or something uh which has to be their doctor but theyre not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that well there are other benefits with the military well i dont that the civilians dont get yeah i dont i dont i dont bad mouth the military too much i had a i had a good time well i just meant from a benefit standpoint well from benefit well thats one of the reasons i made a decision to get out uh i what i perceived as the benefits were just eroding well the their pension plan is really good yeah you know that that part is good except for the except for the little thing that youre paying into social security for twenty years and when you start and then you cant draw it thats right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar and i always thought that that that was a big rip off yeah well on the other side of the fence but still but still  the way it works is that uh some employers although they have a qualified pension plan they dont have a viable pension plan and we wont mention any names dont worry theyre recording every word laughter i know i didnt say it was them oh okay youre youre right youre right but i didnt but but i didnt say it wasnt either thats right we will let them draw their own conclusions thats right draw your own inference but but but what you are saying about the military times is is true i mean fifty percent uh of your base pay is pretty good medical for the rest of your life yeah that you know that sounds great on paper but its not it i uh its not something that i would look would look forward to well we have we have had some medical retire i mean some military retirees work up here for us or a bunch really and they did use the heck out of the medical military medical now the military dental was poor no now at best but the medical seemed somewhat adequate yeah i mean dont get me wrong uh its vocalizednoise for something something that was major i i wouldnt have any problems with them its the daily uh go in with the with the flu or something like that and and the the treatment is terrible i mean first you wait for hours and hours and hours and then the guy says you have a temperature you know well i knew that were going to give you Sudafed you know ive been taking Sudafed for two weeks it doesnt do any good thats all i can do thats all i can do yeah yeah yeah  umhum yeah uh im a member of an HMO and uh from all indications its quite similar to the military yeah yeah well that thats HMOs are designed that way i mean they are going to theyre gonna theyre gonna get the most bang for their buck yeah exactly and and uh you know theyre theyre in the big profit making business the single benefits that i consider among the most important are medical insurance yeah absolutely because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life thats it forever and ever all all you have to do is you dont have it let something bad happen and that hospital will slap a lien on you so fast because they because they do it routinely yeah and yes and the funny thing is that uh private medical insurance is grossly expensive yeah oh i know i know if you are not a member of a group i know my roomies got um the insurance through the school and it it runs fifty eight i think fifty eight bucks a month something like that an thats not bad but you dont get anything thats not bad i mean to tell you well you get what you pay for dont you thats exactly right i mean its its nothing it doesnt cover doctors or anything else its crazy doesnt cover doctors no i mean you can go vocalizednoise it will cover something major but forget about things like uh eyes or your teeth or anything else it it what it is its medical insurance on paper are you covered yes are you covered really no thats right read between the lines are you covered no but you know i mean the whole health care thing in the states is so screwed up that uh yes it uh its its totally ridiculous it its a shame its it is i mean im one of those forty million Americans running around with no health insurance at the moment in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do you have to pay for those that dont have medical insurance i think its two or four dollars a person i dont remember something along those lines but it still the idea irks me so that well its sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create to tax you with or to tax you on theres a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete and assuming youre youre youre at poverty line where youre uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars tacked on to your taxable income yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make oh no but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air i wrote i i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didnt know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you or they did until last year in times past if you got a federal tax you paid state income tax on it the next year on the refund yeah uh Alabama did that too and i always thought well this is pretty nifty you taxed me when i made the money the feds and now youre taxing me again on it yeah the feds took it out and now theyre giving it back to me and now youre going to tax it again i seem i seem to recall recall something about revolutions and wars about double and triple taxation and stuff course uh course it its the by word now i mean let lets tax everything three or four times and there are tax revolutions going on currently yeah there should be but the problem is its not an armed insurrection its not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington no because because quite honestly the American people are so apathetic about everything Washington can do what they want to do and they are trying to take away our guns yeah that too im a lifelong member of the NRA im not as militant as i was when i was younger but i still firmly believe in the rights to to own and bear arms and those people that say that all that amendment to the Constitution was guaranteeing is that we will have a militia yeah thats garbage  i think they are  sorely mistaken theyre theyre wrong the militia in those days was the common man there was no organization of militia the militia made up the the everyday common man and he pulled his squirrel rifle off his wall as he walked out in the yard thats right and and if they said hey we need a militia then all the able bodied men were were supposed to show up ,job_benefits,2600
so uh what do you think laughter i think were overtaxed to the hilt  yeah i mean were were taxed on taxes and um uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who dont have it that is i mean we dont have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through oh really so they have no i didnt realize they had no state tax in Texas no no state income tax oh thats great because they dont have it in Florida in New York they have it i mean you know like i say im in New York and we have a state tax as well so that just cuts even more yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits right i i think that i i mean i wouldnt be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it werent for the fact that they dont they dont go to any place you know you you dont see it going to any place where it belongs i think if it were to be uh if it were to be um if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door if if it were to be spent in the right way i think i wouldnt be so upset about it but given that it that its not spent properly i think its a major problem well were really overburdened from federal state and local that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that theres not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck well thats certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something i think that so they want to you know try and i think theyre trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this they just dont theyre just not very good at doing what theyre supposed to be doing well theyre kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue thats fairness and all is for us to limit their terms and by doing so theyre not obligated to anybody i agree i agree and uh uh i dont know how were going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is its just taking uh  a bite out of our savings right exactly and then and then uh uh im im just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean itd be itd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older you know but im not convinced thats a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who dont need it but i mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it but instead i think its going to the wrong places and i believe the Social Security tax is a great pondsy scheme you think so yeah its uh you know right now theyre robbing from it to pad the federal deficit i know and that scares the hell out of me and i bet thats illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that within their private company theyd be in jail laughter so how are we letting them get away with it yeah i dont i dont well because because theyre the ones who make the laws laughter so whos going to yell at them you know itd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess right laughter to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i dont know if we can do that or not a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless oppose a lot of the situations going on in the taxing system i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if its certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if itll ever be a change process i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong you know all those things that really could be changed that arent you know that that that arent and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list so i dont know i i i have no idea what to do about it well theres no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer its just going to take uh uh really uh uh uh a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer the way its spent see we were we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place thats right we dont i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another right and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do ive never quite understood that ive never uh you know even though um um i ive never been uh sort of politically minded but its never been clear to me as to sort of you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency does doesnt back them up on anything you know and often times that will happen well they feel invulnerable invulnerable to uh any wrath or uh its its occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and dont think about it when the election time arises and generally it does work out that way they do forget its true could because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician whenever the the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this so it becomes uh a general battle of the who um the uh sort of election of the lesser of two evils i think so i dont know i just uh im unhappy with it but and well im im sort of semi fortunate right now im a graduate student so i dont make that much and what i make isnt taxed very highly because im still in school well when you get out into the real world then you will know my my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck im just floored when i see how little of it were actually allowed to keep especially around bonus time bonus time you have a bonus bonus she no my my wife does oh laughter my wife i dont no graduate students dont get bonuses were lucky to get paychecks the way i figure so youre taxed on the bonuses too right my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and thats a thats usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isnt that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something so she gets destroyed on her bonus check so she works with in in in sales so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses uh sales is lucrative but then youre paying really high taxes when youre doing a lucrative job yes well yeah shes not entirely sales so it isnt it isnt as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more so i dont know i dont i guess i guess at this point in time were just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better well i have i guess about said what all all i can think of to say same here tough topic so yeah its really a rather touchy topic at that but laughter i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly its been a pleasure talking with you well thats great you too and uh have a good day thanks for calling you too byebye ,taxes,2622
how do you feel about them well i keep trying to get away from them laughter i used to use a lot of credit cards i guess for a while i would use you know a variety of the the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores but i think i i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things you know i see it on sale and i think oh its on sale i have to get it and i really dont need it or i really havent budgeted for it so um the last couple of years i really have tried not to use them at all what about you well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off and we only have one we tore all the rest of them up laughter okay laughter because i dont like credit cards for one thing you know i mean theyre okay i guess if youre on a trip or something you dont have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but i dont like using because ive seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you dont have to pay for it thats true if if its on the credit card it doesnt seem like its money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i dont have the money so you use the credit card its like fake money or something yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i dont have to pay for it now but youre going to have to pay for it and it seems like yeah you think well i dont have it now but payday will come and then ill have the money but thats probably paying for things that were still owed from last time laughter yes right are you married oh okay well i know that a lot of young people you know i it took me a long time to get it through my childs head i mean that was her goal you know uh got to have a credit card but now that she has one shes only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit but i think it finally sunk in you know because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say you know well i used a credit card and my husbands sister is the worlds worst at oh well ill just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit you know and im im thinking woman laughter wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you but right besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this right and people dont see that either yeah this thing that you thought you got on sale by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time youve spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing right the only one that we we have that we kept was the Discover card and it pays you to use it i mean if you pay your bill off right away if you dont ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it and you make that money as long as you dont ever have to pay them any uh interest now its and people say well you know im making money by using this credit card but they dont realize that if they i mean it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest i mean you have to pay the interest not pay it right off thats going to take up what you would have made so thats the only reason that we kept that we debated for a long time plus they dont have that um charge on it you know like yeah right they dont have one of those service charge you mean yearly fee yeah so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time yes yes and then ill ill have just like uh department stores theyll call me up you know and ill say look i dont want the credit card well were just going to send it to you you know you dont have to ever use it if you dont want to theyll send me any credit card i tear it up what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks i just cant see it and they say hey you know two thousand dollars you know free to you kind of thing you know all you got to do is go cash those things and youve got a short term loan i hate it laughter i cant believe they have the nerve to do that i know it and you know what whats really bad about those though is just like young people if they dont you know we take the time to you know help my daughter shes in college but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she tertore tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time you know and they wouldnt even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know theyve got something maybe theyve won something you know somebody sent them something free and go out and spend it laughter umhum and um its just unreal i mean i dont like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen she got uh i cant remember what she called it its some kind of maybe its sure or something like that its something its some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and im going you just got off thats how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person laughter but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want  yeah and i just dont see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatevers leftover thats what you have but um maybe a lot of people dont see it like that but i cant stand owing i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess its just because ive been brought up like that but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out but thats just the way i feel about it yeah i think its its somewhat a um symptom of our me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my parents always you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup and you dont you know do without too much and you know thats how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and thats you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually theyre kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it but were not into that were into like have to have it all now oh yeah i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that but um i guess its because im older i mean im not real old but i am older and um you know i didnt feel like that i didnt feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because well i had everything when i was at home but i i dont know why i didnt laughter well were geared to that were like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and going okay well its going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and ill save for two years people go oh well ill just go buy it put it on credit and ill pay it off people arent tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it they just put it on a charge card put it on account and then pay off the bill because they want it now its always have to have it now yeah um well it didnt hurt you did it to i mean you didnt go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you laughter no no but i have had some times when ive had some pretty good balances on there and uh you know i finally you know paid them all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we dont uh have big balances on them at all now were were you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off were yeah well you learned then right yeah you learn the you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest and ive never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had enough to itemize and so its just a big chunk of money and you realize that youre not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item because youve got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what forty dollars sometimes just to have the card thats a lot of money that you went to buy this item umhum so then and then you never feel like youve got anything to to put into savings or anything youre always just paying bills paying bills you know you dont feel that you have any extra to save and i hate i hate living paycheck to paycheck i like to have a little there you know that i can save so i can feel that you know if something comes up ive got the money to pay for it ,credit_card,2642
are you are you a TIer Carla yeah i am oh and you work in the Sherman plant uh whereabouts uh in the front end the wafer fab oh okay good deal oh im in Dallas im in uh in SC group QRA i im kind of a worldwide quality manager based here in Dallas uh mostly the offshore assembly sites where do you work oh great oh wow except im fixing not to be a TIer after a week from today you going to Motorola no im going to Onum uh its a subcontractor house they uh they builds in fact they build product for TI but its been thirty two years so i mean ive ive served ive done my time oh yeah okay you ready to talk about taxes okay oh yeah were you happy with your return this year laughter were you happy with your tax return this year what did you say no laughter no  was it negative okay i guess were on the air now uh well what do you uh what do you think uh uh vocalizednoise what whats your biggest gripe do you think is it the proposed state income tax or the or the gigantic federal income tax we seem to be paying every year or what i think my biggest gripe is the gigantic federal income tax i came from a state that paid uh state taxes three years ago and that seemed to be relatively small compared to like the uh the tax you pay on sales sale items umhum umhum and um i dont know i think uh my biggest gripe is with federal what what state are you from Carla Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax yeah though its a percentage you divide that well you uh how much you paid or something by your federal oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing okay because theres a lot of tax breaks for like you know a lot of things if youre involved in the state like uh giving to colleges and things like that that theyll break you for oh i see okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it um not even sure because i was a student so i didnt pay that much oh okay okay but uh and because as as you know where uh theres theres uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas right and what percent would that be uh i have no idea i i i uh im im originally from Massachusetts but they didnt have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is but you know getting back to the vocalizednoise getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff uh i dont believe it its worse laughter i know well you cant deduct for credit card interest that type of thing oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and uh yeah the only thing thats left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically yeah laughter right right and would then and and thats significant and every once in a while they make noises like theyre going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did oh yeah and and uh one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in in Malaysia for TI and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because ill ill have a lot of equity in my house then when my children are old enough to go to college ill get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so ill be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part oh wow guess what what happened that thats not legal in Texas its the only state in the country that its not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas oh my gosh and and so i i got this i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that ive got almost paid off and have all kinds of equity in it and dont have laughter and you know laughterstruggling to keep ive got two children in college and im going to have three by September laughter oh man but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because ive heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year oh yeah and and im not exactly sure what what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i dont know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes and now were paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with fifty cents its incredible and it is it is absolutely incredible and and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible uh is you know do you have children in school no i dont i just got married i dont have any children oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Texas how long you been in Texas three years oh okay well youll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state thats got a very decent public school system and youll find out that in Texas weve got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise laughtertaxes spend more laughtermoney vocalizednoise i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldnt have so much money going to so many different schools yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the weve got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is theyve got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas yeah ive heard that uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything and and and theyve got uh i dont know what the ratio is but theyve got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching and it is sort of like we do at TI sounds like TI is was getting ready laughterto laughter yeah yeah we get we get fat in laughterthose laughterareas and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got yeah and then all your money goes to overhead uh and and get them in the classroom plus uh i dont know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that arent going allow first first of all theyre not college prep courses and i dont think theyre going vocalizednoise help a person make a living theyre just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate and laughter and and all that and uh so im im not im not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isnt it right in Dallas it uh might be a little less here in Sherman yeah i i think right here in Dallas were paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts ive been here thirty two years but they used to call it Taxachusetts and uh i was there on business this last weekend oh really and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent oh wow i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesnt cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents oh really for it laughterand and i notice theirs doesnt cut in much below fifty cents i think so so the little items you pay what the price tag says now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax i dont know i i dont i bet theyre not i ill absolutely bet theyre not it its interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because ive only heard of it in bits and pieces but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes oh man laughter laughterthey laughterwere laughtergoing laughterto they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i i hadnt uh uh i havent heard that i havent heard that much about it uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana Indiana think it was like five and a half percent uhhuh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana vocalizednoise Indiana University yeah Purdue vocalizednoise no Purdue oh Purdue okay you were you were a Boilermaker huh yeah yeah you follow the girls uh basketball team boy we were were were were tremendous uh girls basketball fans here and we saw them we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin last year oh yeah oh great and we were Lady Longhorn fans naturally but we did see Purdue so were aware uh that theyve that theyve got a very good program there vocalizednoise yeah they well its just been the last three or four years actually they had poor seasons before that but yeah and i think they went further this year uh i i think they got into the second or third round of the of the playoff this year yeah yeah they yeah theyve been exciting to watch yeah and uh thats an vocalizednoise what did you get get your degree in okay supervision supervision thats an interesting degree uh what what sort of things does it entail lot of theory um its pretty its pretty broad uh took some engineering courses some math a lot of uh a lot of theory lot of practical like personal um problems and personnel problems and that type of thing vocalizednoise are you are you actively in supervision now have have you taken some of the TI supervisory skill courses yeah the The Boss Course yeah the Boss Course yeah that was a really good course yeah and and i was i was going to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of vocalizednoise ,taxes,2668
okay laughter um do you have a favorite credit card that you use um i probably use my Discover card more than anything else because any particular reason uh no i really dont use too many credit cards im not fond of them i dont like using them but ive just gotten to the point where id rather carry that instead of cash yeah i know what you mean but vocalizednoise but the thing is i always carry it with my checkbook so if i have i just pay for it with my check instead of i think ive only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times oh really wow well i use um a credit card thats given out by US Air well not given out i mean theres an annual fee um and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile and um vocalizednoise my husband and i tend to charge a lot and even things that we wouldnt normally charge now we charge because weve racked up seriously close in the past couple years close to five or six thousand dollars just by charging and um its really great because you can get some good discounts um on US Air you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that um and the annual fee isnt bad i think its maybe thirty five dollars a year um and here in Rochester maybe in in Pennsylvania also but you can charge your groceries yeah uhhuh yeah can you do that there which is great with only only vocalizednoise certain cards they accept though they dont accept all kinds of cards like they only accept the major cards oh do do they accept Discover or no um i dont know they do accept the Discover but i know they would accept like Visa Master Card umhum yeah well i love it and now um actually our our mortgage company is uh starting i think June first or something is going to start allowing people to charge their mortgage oh my and thats going to be great um and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest i refuse to pay interest if im going to do that im not going to use a credit card so what i do now is i i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it routout i write it out so im not fooling myself into thinking i have that money you know i write it out and then its its as if i paid in cash exactly yeah so youre somebody that will pay off your bills right away uh yes yes definitely that see that if if i dont have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge i have to have that money before ill charge it umhum yep i know what you mean i refuse well im a college student and im a finance major so laughter i just laughter and um i dont i oh my gosh i probably i have a Discover card well that makes sense i have an ATT card but i dont use it because i dont even know where it is i put it away like two years ago because i thought if i dont see it i wont use it which is really good because then i you know vocalizednoise a lot of my friends have like outrageous phone bills but i dont have it because i dont use mine oh yeah and um i know i have Montgomery Wards i have a um a J C Penneys i have a Kaufmans you know i have a Fashion Bug i have vocalizednoise a whole bunch of them and i just used my J C Penney card and its a year old and that was the first time ive ever used it really well yeah i just i dont think to use them all the time vocalizednoise and if i do use one i would rather use my Discover card one and theyre getting to the point now too at the end of the year all the money that youve youve charged on theyll pay you i think its ten percent back a discount yeah yeah so you know i even got a couple dollars back umhum its definitely worth it if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea because you dont have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at the beginning of the month then youre getting a months worth of interest in your account um but the second you let it go even one month um they had made an error on our statement where they they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything and um i mean for that amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge oh my gosh thats like another purchase for me it buying something yeah me too laughter that would definitely laughterbe laughterfor laughterme laughtertoo umhum yeah but um you know one thing one of the reasons because i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and and a lot of reason i have those cards is because J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it uh thats why i have it laughter yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and and uh as long as it because i dont J C Penney doesnt cost you anything i dont think no huhuh no right and so as long as it doesnt cost you anything then that that yeah and being a college student i get um applications for them all the time i think uh once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if theres an annual fee if theres an annual fee i ditch it because i dont use them that often so it wouldnt even pay me to get it even if it was you know oh yeah and uh my Discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it and now she buys everything with her Discover Discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know and that way shes getting the interest on it too because then at at the end of the year they give her back her interest umhum oh yeah oh right and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year uh wow that is great so i mean she might spend three thousand but if you get thirty of it back you know thats thats still thirty dollars less right and thats thirty dollars that you didnt pay any money to have it in the first place exactly and she you know my moms like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes one thing i still dont understand about credit cards is how you can borrow money off a credit card i still havent quite figured that out i havent tried it i laughterdont laughtertrust laughterit laughter i know i dont trust it either and um i know you can do it with a Visa card but it just seems like too simple and i know that theres some hidden theres so theres so much fine print that i dont understand that i wont even try it yeah yeah yeah i just rely on my Mac card laughter on your what my Mac card just take it out of the laughterbank oh just yeah the machine one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone or you know if i i i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the shoppers thing but sometimes theyll be something good that theyre selling a record or something like that and um and after i do it i think God who did i give my number to and um you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever but um the credit card company i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didnt even know the the store and they took it right off no questions i just said this isnt my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you cant then um you know just take it off thats good yeah they usually i think theyre usually pretty good about that uh i mean they they probably realized it was their mistake if if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so oh yeah yeah they would pursue it definitely yeah uhhuh i really im im starting to use my credit card more like i said im a college student and the past two semesters i bought my books with it oh yeah so and i run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books umhum um yeah so thats approximately between five and six hundred dollars that i put on it and i just keep thinking oh good im going to get that back im going to get a little bit back laughter uhhuh right yeah thats true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes but now you cant do it and i know people that have racked up they keep they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it i cant see that and then and all they can do is is pay the minimum balance or not that you know and when they do that all theyre doing is paying the interest on it theyre not even paying the principal exactly oh nope theyre not even touching it i i uh uh when uh when i get to people like that i wish i i think the company should just say uh were not giving you any more until you pay this off i know vocalizednoise i mean i realize that the company wants you to use it you know and extend it all the time theyre making more money off you but i think they should have the the consumer vocalizednoise the most interest you know laughter yeah its true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls its like theyre addicted to using their credit card or something oh yeah some people are they really are i mean if if they have if they know they have more more on their limit that i i might i think my brotherinlaw is laughterlike laughterthat laughteractually but um he vocalizednoise if he has a hundred dollars left until he reaches his limit hell spend it oh my God he cant because to him its like money to him its like a a loan almost in a sense and he cant bear to i cant i i cant do that no i cant either i have like i said i have to i know have to know that i have that money before ill spend it so i i i dont i dont know laughter of course my mom lives very she was she had twelve kids and of course she vocalizednoise she watched her money all the time and i that was one good thing i did get off of her i know oh my God uh i dont mind spending my money as long as its a necessity and if its something i really really want but just to go out and start buying im not like that and thats something i got off of her and im ,credit_card,2682
okay youve do you have a uh monthly budget well um we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i i think im a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts well have our checking account thats just the the money that we use and spend and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check so were never we pay off our bills in full were not paying any interest but its not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already and then we have another checking account another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know thats just taken out of our paychecks every week and then we have a a fourth sort of CD type arrangement um where you know its in a CD and we cant get to it so i guess our budget is just whats in our checkbook we dont say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas its just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times um so theres nothing really that we have written down for a budget but im a saver i would rather if i had twenty extra dollars i would rather save it than spend it and thats my philosophy and um sometimes i i you know i think that thats not necessarily the best way to live but i i always think that youre going to need it for a rainy day you know how about you well were very very similar we i have worked for a goal of saving three months salary and and we put that uh in a account and we just leave it there thats our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months salary now weve only weve recently done that so now we have extra money we dont have to slap in that account so were looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money uh see we do have the checking account we have Carla works for TI so she has a CODA plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar she she puts in a dollar you know TI pays fifty cents oh thats great its sort of like a matching fund then she gets like eight percent interest on top of that so thats been uh pretty juicy for last couple of years umhum yeah thats wonderful one nice thing that my company does um and i know this is going on all over the country but they allow you to put into um a certain fund whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year lets say you determine thats five hundred dollars theyll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two and what what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars do you have something like that no well they may have we just havent taken advantage of it its really wonderful in our case we dont have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week thats taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the its Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasnt taxed on initially because it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and its really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year i im just going to claim a lot more if you dont spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it huh so but uh its a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if youd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and theyll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing but um so if you dont use it in one year you lose the hum yes if you dont lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty they let you know each quarter and theyll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you havent spent that fifty then you do lose it well its time to go get your teeth cleaned again yeah right laughter or just buy a new set of glasses or laughter or whatever oh yeah thats thats true too but i i dont know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget thats really written out um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks youre just going to go over that and some weeks youre going to go under and so to me its just easier to well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money were going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it i dont know yeah thats true thats true thats true yeah a very good point so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because i hate interest laughter yeah right oh i hate it too so i mean but some people dont care about interest well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left theyll spend that because they think they have it and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically right its a vicious circle yeah it really is yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly but they can be very dangerous if you dont oh they sure can thats for sure especially yeah that interest is terrible i know and you know they send these applications out to college kids and college kid gets an application that says youve been approved for this amount of credit vocalizednoise automatic approval and they get them and then these kids start charging and and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they laughtereven start making money theyre already in debt laughteryou laughterknow let alone loans and stuff oh yeah no kidding yeah that sounds like you uh now what are you doing youve got your big master savings account that youre going to use to retire on or something or well itll be a long time before thats something we can retire on but um its yeah its just uh something thats automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed oh man and it wasnt covered by insurance so thats something where you you dont plan on its not something that you can you know youre not saving for a trip or whatever its boom here it is and you just have to pay for it so its an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that thats whats put in the CD and to me i i try and forget that we even have that because i dont want to think about that um but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe well just go out and buy something with this and itll come yeah yeah we i just did that my wifes birthday was yesterday and yeah so ah really im very tight you know with my cash and we havent really we dont go to malls and shop because theyre too expensive and you know well buy things here and there but she had we havent really went shopping for her umhum laughter oh yeah itll and you know but shes been really good and she hasnt really said much and i go well look you know today were going to go out and get something so we went out and blew about a hundred bucks but you know for us thats a thats huge for me you know but you know some people do it every weekend oh isnt it great oh i know you mean umhum oh its incredible we really do i i i like discount stores i have no problem with buying an a no name brand of something um im not into labels and that sort of thing our fire our smoke detectors going off laughter making French fries uh oh youre not cooking are you um my husbands making French fries laughter or burning French fries one or the other but um thats funny i feel fortunate that my parents instilled in me you know a sense to save and and you know watch where your money goes and i thats very valuable yeah yeah well thats good thats good sounds like uh you know what youre doing yeah i hope so we do you too was your wife always like this or was she did you have to did i have to train her yeah laughter no she shes really good she uh she didnt uh you know she doesnt go out and buy clothes without me knowing it and like Blondie in the cartoons you know she doesnt do anything like that shes not big on sales and all that shes just really shes really great shes really content and just uses what she has and then i know kind thats great you know she just you know some day ,family_finance,2697
Texas how you doing all right good good good have you been participating in this uh program very much oh uh ever since they really got started oh okay uh maybe a phone call a week or something like that yeah yeah i try to get one a day and im leaving the country here in next week and i laughterwant laughterto laughterget laughterevery i want to get as many as i can uh okay Bill you about ready to get started i guess so uh Bill what kind of a company you with im with a  electronics company oh okay ive been an engineer all my life and uh thats one of the the issues that i have with the company that uh you know salary is is one benefit but uh i feel as an engineer that uh you know i take pride in my work and uh getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and uh having challenging work uh doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time right uh do do you think the benefits package is fair i think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company but uh you know its uh sometimes quite a struggle to uh to do work thats challenging and find challenging assignments i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that uh you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation uh how how old are you Bill im uh fifty four oh hey im fifty seven sounds like same situation here uh im with TI of course and our our benefits it its interesting uh because thats one of the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the food or laughter or other things uh however recently ive had a chance to sample the outside and uh probably by industry standards were probably in the top seventy percent uh the uh uh ive ive really in fact what im doing is im uh retiring effective Tuesday and going with another company uh primarily for some of the things that you stated uh ive spent uh eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in Asia and ive just had a real ball and uh since ive been back part of my job is is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants which is okay but the other part laughter the other parts pushing paper and uh uh which i dont like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly house that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting and and im going to do that beginning the first of May but uh uh interestingly interestingly interestingly enough though uh the the biggest grind ive been with ive been with TI thirty two years uh the biggest gripe in TI is the benefits package but as i go looking at other companies as ive ive had a chance to do uh its really not all that bad uh that the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess theyve all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical care yes i think so and and i i think thats the type of thing that uh uh that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company Bill ive been there thirty two years thirty two ha ha sounds familiar laughter what kind of vacation uh uh restrictions do you have or or shouldnt say restrictions policy well after being there for this long i get uh four weeks a year and i have an option to uh trade salary for an extra week oh neat neat neat uh when when did you get into the uh uh when did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks uh let me see how does it work uh after you get two weeks up until five years and then you get an additional day uh each year thereafter up until ten years and then thereafter every other year you get an additional day so by the time youve been there twenty years you get the four weeks you get a full four weeks yeah yeah we get two weeks after a year uh uh three three three weeks between five and fifteen and four weeks over fifteen hum okay and uh uh are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue none no carryover whatsoever oh so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or or you lose it okay well weve got were allowed to accrue a fair bunch im not exactly sure uh on a year to year basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions uh and then they they grandfathered our old days uh but what it what it uh the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days which is fourteen weeks which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with with retiring here in the next three days uh i have eighty five days vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didnt get to do that so im in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back but at least i get paid for seventy days which in your situation you dont i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in that current year right thats right uhhuh uhhuh thats interesting interesting now were allowed to accrue sick leave but uh oh okay well see we we dont have any any such thing as sick leave uh if youre exempt and youve been here over three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program hum okay yes we do yeah and we get half half pay uh or full pay for six months and half pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works and uh uh thats interesting how how many vacation days do yall get you mean uh mean holidays yeah i meant holidays yeah i dont know the exact count uh they took away some of the minor holidays a few years back and we get Christmas week off oh okay okay so it probably all adds up to the same vocalizednoise so yeah we traded in Veterans Day and uh and i guess Good Friday or something like that uh in favor of having a week off at Christmas i im not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at Christmas time because yeah it yeah yeah no i guess thats true i i guess see most of us and like yourself where youve got four weeks you can take plenty throughout the year and still have a week even if it werent a company holiday youd still have some time left over at Christmas and uh i i guess what happens is we dont have Christmas week we have Christmas plus a day around Christmas a day before or a day after as official holidays but theres so many people that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant well i think thats the reason our plant went that way what we we have uh a lot of uh government contract work and we find that in that last uh couple of week of the year all the government people are use it or lose it situation yeah probably laughter yeah so theyre all gone yeah laughterso laughterall laughterour laughtercustomers laughterare laughternonexistent yeah yeah thats thats what happened to us i think the last the last holiday we got was in the middle uh seventies and uh uh and that one was the uh Friday after Thanksgiving and i think the reason we got it for a holiday was nobody laughterworked laughterit laughteranyway laughterit laughterjust laughterkept laughterus from taking a days vacation uh we get we get uh New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving and the day after and then Christmas and a day either side of it oh okay which which comes out to about nine and uh and and just since ive been here i mean when i got here we didnt even get Memorial Day huh thats strange and it it wasnt recognized here in the deep South laughter and we got uh uh and Good Friday came along i think uh in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on on that versus the Friday after Thanksgiving because we didnt get that day then and i always felt that it wasnt a religious motive that gave us Good Friday the the the employees voted for Good Friday it was just that New Years Day to Memorial Day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring yeah were sort of in that situation we do get uh uh George Washingtons birthday but its still a long dry stretch from then until uh Memorial Day oh okay so you yeah are are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance uh im kind of cross with it this year we changed uh uh managers for the plan we had been with Blue Cross and Blue Shield and uh we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system but theyve gone to a managed care program and we had to even even though we were right in the middle of the area we had to opt out because there are no physicians in the area that are taking patients oh my goodness and its absolutely pathetic up here uh so far the insurance company owes us about two thousand dollars and the checks are not coming in my goodness thats tough uh we had uh weve been with Aetna actually i think we find fund our own insurance program Aetna just administers paying the bills yeah thats the way our company works yeah and and and the uh uh they started out with having Managed Mental Health Care and then they went to Managed Hospital Network where you had to go to a network hospital and we just got a notice the other day saying that uh that were going to have uh uh network doctors and and theyre going to the way theyre going to work into this is theyre going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people and uh write to them all and tell them that theyve got an opportunity laughter to be part of this program and they and yeah our in our area they all turned it down they say forget it uh if this patient wants to wants to go somewhere else let him go there no kidding ,job_benefits,2706
anyway what are your what are your first comments on that uh  my first comments on the budget i would say there has what would you start cutting first what would be the first thing youd cut surprisingly no i would i would cut the prison systems and let them selfsupport mean private enterprise have private enterprise enterprise do it you mean the prisons uhhuh theyre already talking about it i mean theyre talking about um having it uh as a you know business uh to uh you know to so the you know the government doesnt have to deal with it i hadnt heard that but uh yeah because i think its all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obviously so but um but to me but see theyre they dont have enough um you know theres theres not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to maybe have uh you know private you know business private enterprise come in so well see the other way im thinking about is they should be selfsupporting like um the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be selfsupporting within themselves in other words theyre in there for a purpose put them to work rather than sitting there its the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldnt say criminal but the whole police department of the United States i feel the same way uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there so its self defense you know selfdefense on that point as far as my defense uh theyre cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldnt want to see it cut any more than that but again id like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today so im lost on that one i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what weve got yeah its tough to to say what um you know what uh as far as this  that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that they so uh well not so much pay im not trying to see the government put out any more no yeah i know what you are saying but im just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here it you know its just up to high school yeah but see we dont even push the fact to the high school kids that theres other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up you know why not an apprentice out to a a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or you know just a technician you can learn on the job which of course again which mean would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean its not going to be overnight but that would come down i think the program you know thats one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh theyre not willing to you know to put that you know the training for only a certain amount so um its you know as far as the technical side but uh even like one one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff i mean they theyre trying to get more people into that field but they cant just bring somebody in without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work you know for a lawyer as a paralegal excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and shes training her umhum well yeah i im well yeah i you know im assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know ive been with a couple of big companies now and its like theyd are unwilling to put the time in you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously theres uh uh you know theres a lot to learn uh after that but but uh thats true im im sure theres a lot of um you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel ive got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up is that better yes laughter wow laughter yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world laughtersomewhere anyway so um but uh you know i think uh they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people you know stuff like that programs like that you know i dont know you know what kind of options theyve got well thats something about what Germanys supposed to be doing something similar to that right now and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school theyre they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around because they dont have any education i dont mean college and im for college but theres a lot of people that dont want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned theyve had it yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree so i thought that was interesting but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so oh yeah but theres a lot of them out there that havent yeah well i just you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and so thats yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on and they go to college etcetera well it seems to me that kids that are get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if theyre said hey its just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more theyll make a lot happier life for themselves question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do well as  as far as the you know the deficit thats a whole nother uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and theres not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goods you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know  and um you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know were going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours but um its just that uh theyre in  i think youre youre going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh uh the money you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we dont sell you know we dont uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in so were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldnt even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting ,budget,2708
i started when i was in college you know they always offer credit cards for college students so i went ahead and and accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early so i pack i pack around a lot of them but i only use a few of them you have a lot of discipline they make it really easy for people to uh to get credit cards especially college students i have uh two daughters who who both are in college or in fact one has finished now but they both have laughter a lot of credit cards and they give you such high credit limits its its easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap uh right and then they they give you uh uh the credit limit and then youre always seemingly seemingly up to that limit now i have quite a few credit cards that im always almost up to the limit on most of them and thats thats how a lot of people get into trouble yeah ive got ive got two that i you know that usually ill have a a balance on and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and and pay it off every month that way i feel like im getting you know a thirty day loan but i dont have to worry about you know running them up too high except at Christmas then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty laughtergood yeah well you have a lot of discipline i uh im trying my best right now to pay off some of mine i ive paid off about four credit cards this year and uh but still i have some that are laughter are up to the limit and especially the Visa card that you can go and get cash on laughter it seems like every time im short of cash i just go get get it from Visa now thats one thats ive never used my Visa for cash before can you use it like at a bank machine or it well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say i want a cash advance or if theyve sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh Impact machines or whatever you you can do that oh okay because i have one that i dont have a pin number for you know sometimes you have to ask them for that and then i have one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically now we got thats thats funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadnt even applied for then a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers and then we got a a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars and we we cut them up and sent them back because we we hadnt even applied for them and we didnt want them but they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us oh wow laughter so i thought man i dont know if i trust this or not laughter laughter well they they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card its like lets see if we can get her to run up her bills laughter but its hard i mean its its tempting when you see something to say well ill just charge it and sometimes ill do that but usually i i will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that that usually have an outstanding balance all the time ill ill pay more than the minimum payment just i feel i feel like even that little bit helps right well you know the way the economys going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible thats thats why ive ive really started to try to to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might you know get laid off or something especially me i work for Texas Instruments and theyve had had a lot of of uh you know layoffs lately i know it well i work for TI too you do and i think theyre getting ready to to probably sell us out our division where are you in Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City uhhuh i know theyre selling out somebody in Colorado Springs yeah they just they just announced that didnt they so i mean its its kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards it it certainly is ive um i have worked on a part part time job um where i was a collector for um uh uh a jewelry company laughter people um that they just had this jewelry account it was Zales Jewelry in fact and uh a whole bunch of people i mean they have about a laughterthousand collectors i guess and uh theres just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just cant pay for it something something happens you know you hear so many stories listening to them like uh you know they lost their job or uh they theyve signed for a friend you know they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend laughter wouldnt pay them and now theyre stuck with the bill and its ruining their credit and didnt pay them vocalizednoise you really have to watch it this you know because yeah because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know automatically most most of them do thats scary i didnt realize that yeah and if you if youre uh its bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then youre youre not past due until the fifteenth of the next month but oh okay you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth youre not one day late youre thirty laughterdays late they dont they dont recognize any time difference do they right laughter and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of ooh thats scary thats something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like umhum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs about ten dollars might be worth it for peace of mind oh yeah it is it is you might even find somebodys been reporting on you and you laughterdidnt even know it you know you i mean you might think youre paying something on time or and you by that day and youre thirty vocalizednoise thirty days is not real bad though anyway if youve got a charge off on your credit report report or something like that thats when it really gets bad or something you havent paid in sixty days or ninety days you know things like that i think that Discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you dont go crazy trying to get cash back and since they dont have the yearly fee do they charge a lot of interest on that card i dont i dont know ive never i havent gotten one just because its i i felt like with Visa and MasterCard and American Express you didnt need another one i would think it wouldnt be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges so that that wouldnt be too bad well always watch out for somebody anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia or theres a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty one and twenty two percent interest i know i had a charge with uh Spiegel laughter and i hadnt read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance off you know and i looked at the credit card agreement one day and it was like twenty three percent interest holy cow and thats the one bill that i hurry up hurried and paid up and and ive always watched it since then you really have to watch those interest rates definitely thats awful i mean theres no point in giving them any more money than we have to laughterso thats true laughter so anyway they cant bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in Texas but there there are a couple of states that can well thats great and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta laughter Atlanta Georgia laughter ill try to remember that one laughter see i was trying to think if there was anything else so i guess the worst problem i ever had with with a credit card though was um i got a an item on my bill that i had never purchased i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they werent supposed to process it until they delivered it and i changed my mind but then they went ahead and charged it on my account and it took me about eighteen months to get that all of that mess off of my account so thats thats probably the worst thing ive ever had happen with a credit card i wonder if they ,credit_card,2710
all right well how do you use credit cards Carol scarily very very very seldom only in dire emergencies in fact i leave them home is that from past experience bad experiences in the past or or just uh the fact that you dont want to be tempted i have never ive used them but never to the extent of getting in debt like uh some people do its just that since my money is tight right now i dont even give myself a tempting because ive gotten them all paid off so now i just wait before i use it but um like ill keep one minor one like Sears in my purse just for identification purposes because i wont use it period but like if youd take a trip or something ill use bank uh Visa yeah do you but otherwise huhuh do you order a lot of things over the phone or credit card orders never so uh like if you go to uh K WalMart or something you always pay in cash or with a check umhum cash check very seldom do i even use cash um so your money funnels directly into your checking account huh how about you me i have a Discover card and i use that when when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my Discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra because they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then ill pay my credit cards off in full every month so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do and also Discover card gives you a little bit of money back its not much but you know five or six bucks uh instead of writing a check for a large purchase if im disciplined enough i can uh like well uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know ill get some of that back through the cash back program and also at the end of the month you know ill get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like uh id say its about fifty fifty writing a check or using the Discover card it just i dont know for some reason it just depend if its something small i dont want to write a uh use my credit card but thats the only one i have and and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and uh which is i just if they have a toll free number ill call it up and you know charge it to my credit card as as long as you know id make myself pay on time every time so theres no finance charge and its really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend uh they think because theyve got a thousand dollar limit then you know theyve got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying finance charges and they just and then theyll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it see thats exactly i didnt get in debt but what i did was one year oh i cant remember when five six must be eight nine years ago when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax writeoff but there was no sense to it i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and ill turn around like on my car ill borrow against my insurance which i pay five percent interest and buy my car that way and that works so i dont have to worry about it but i use uh override at uh Texin Credit Union so that i dont have to keep too much i keep enough balance in my checking account so i dont have to pay you know a service charge what you override and then i yeah whats that mean if i write a check real large itll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account oh okay so i dont have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there okay i see so it just you know and i pretty much budget that way all the way around but as i said my moneys tight yeah is that a free service that override right now theres no charge for it so i do it that way but i do as i said i keep the credit card in my purse for identification when somebody wants identification one way or the other but usually i wont put anything on that card unless its something i really unbelievably need otherwise i better have it somewhere else because im like you im not going to have a balance on that thing because its too easy i know too many people that pay off that card well ive got this credit card well maybe id better use that one or something like that and im saying huhuh not me its just its just so easy when uh okay i think a lot of its psychological you hand a piece of plastic and all you do is sign your name at least either with cash or with a check  you have to write out the amount so you actually see how much youre spending well its like um the little piece of plastic for uh to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other and like ill run down there like you know for vacation and things like that and ill leave it in there in savings account till the last day and then ill put the card in and pull it out what i want but ill pull it out of savings because i dont keep any balance in the checking but thats still thats easy enough as it is but i wouldnt use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it oh yeah no kidding i wont even go that far laughteri complain every time i i mean weve only had to do it twice since my wife and ive been married in nine months is use the machine that charges and it charges a buck and one time it was because the machine at TI was broken and we had to have cash so we had no choice but to go to the other place and the other one was just this weekend when we just we were leaving out of town and we had to you know just have some cash and so we used the automatic teller card but you know im very chintzy with my money i dont like to spend lose a dollar just because i use a machine or something its but im like you if theres something really that i wanted ill write to them before ill put the credit card call in though i wont put it on the card unless i really ill take write them letter uh check for it yeah thats because it wastes too much time on the credit card and im kind of im leery about things going on my card because ive had you know had to go back and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago so im having real good luck with a credit card i mean it came off theres no problem but it just takes too much scares me and like Tom Thumbs got uh credit card now they used for groceries yeah over here in in Plano their own Tom Thumb card and you can charge your groceries on it thats funny and uh you can either charge your groceries on it you have a choice or you can write a check and they okayed it that way so you dont have to keep going and get it you know credit check and things like that and theyll give you an extra twenty five dollars no charge or anything else like that but i wont even put that on the groceries because hey what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or something like that and i dont check it yeah yeah no thank you i dont want anything going on my card you know in my checking account unless its i know about it but do you like Discover card i hadnt heard too much about it yeah it seems a lot more places are taking it now which when i first got it it was a problem with it i i said i dont want to use the credit card and i just carried it with me like you said for identification and sometimes when i would take it go on a trip you know it it was good to have a credit card because like if my car breaks down or something a vocalizednoise lot of states dont because i travel from Indiana to Texas and a lot of states wont take out of state checks like you know just some gas station out of the way they want cash or a major card so i went ahead and got that and theres no fee no service fee for it plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isnt very much but id just started to use it and and like i i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like uh i wrote a check for my wifes wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the Discover card the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back on uh the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know im still not in its not a good habit to use it but fortunately im not uh like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it then i ill use the Discover card you know to get a little more interest but uh yeah i im just very vocalizednoise ,credit_card,2718
about how many calls have you made on this system uh ive originated only a a few oh okay yeah but ive received quite a few i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck thats right im supposed to make a few calls so i started about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all uh our little gift book goes up to but i dont really know oh yeah ive got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have youve vocalizednoise a few yeah ive been getting mine okay uh medical go ahead im vocalizednoise im medical thats mine uh you pushed the record button were supposed to be discussing the subject yeah i im benefits go ahead you first yeah uh well ill tell you ive been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh its hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either that we get from TI im quite pleased with it course theres a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEOs seat but um oh yeah i think Jerrys doing a pretty good job as it goes the one vocalizednoise its kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although ive used medical a little bit uh that well that one certainly is high i i worry that its weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say id like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better then salary salary salary continuance ive never used that one i hope i never will but thats kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one well vocalizednoise ah yes thats like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there well uh like i say i worked for several different companies and theres nothing to compare with uh TI here now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff uh i wasnt with GSI but i was connected with uh uh oil uh exploration with TI or somebody else no with TI but i say i wasnt connected with GSI oh right yeah and i got caught up in a layoff now uh course you get six months uh unemployment from the state but what TI did for us is is uh i ive never heard of it before they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance uh computers a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us uh they had out of town newspapers and then the company and outside consultants didnt they have an outside consultant too i beg your pardon did they have an outside consultant like a uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while the employee uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us but the most important thing was that uh they had made up the difference between uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay and they then TI paid me that oh really so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off yeah they seem to be doing doing a good job of that im in facilities and and our organization vocalizednoise built builds those facilities over in Park Central now and i guess theyve been using them for six months now and ive known several engineers that got laid off and they said its like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after theyve been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh uh an assistance trying to find another job to have an office yeah yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job oh uhhuh well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably yeah apparently its very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyones doing well thats one of those little uh uh little extras that you dont see in the uh the the the handbook you know right youre absolutely right thats a good one what do you think about pensions anything on that or well now i have uh uh im getting close to retirement and of course ive been looking into it but uh since im only a yellow badger i wont be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a K account i ive been thinking about that for years uh ive never heard of such a thing i know thats what im saying that that pensions you see just like you were youre saying youve only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after youre vested and then just add the money together like you do with a K account you know uh yeah uh its your account period it doesnt matter where you go or anything thats your account to roll over i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didnt know there was such a thing no no there isnt i im saying thats the question what do you think could be better and im saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will i think they ought to have a pension at least that youd never lose you work for a company seven years yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security uh well social securitys going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and its not paid for by the current like when say we retire after the year two thousand social securitys paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel and you wont have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it its there you dont have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know yeah yeah thats just a thought i mean i uhhuh no i i like the idea course thats thats some something like an IRA if they say which yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i dont really know but i i can see where theyd need to do something on that because the statistics are you dont work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know you work for five six seven and you you a lot of people i know guys yeah that thats what ive done i ive bounced around about every ten years i change yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah ive only got uh ive got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then youd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh i havent used it i guess you im sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but im not im talking about major items i havent used it for anything major im glad its there though well knock wood i havent used mine anything for anything major just doctor visits and well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna i have the regular i again i just i havent i cant complain about it because i havent used it and every time i needed it it its uh its uh you know fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess im the one just supporting most of the others well doesnt it work that you dont see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum dont you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred uh yeah yeah i think its two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh yeah well now i have the same dental you have okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible uhhuh now see i dont have a deductible yeah right i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs well drugs are okay now im on that uh plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve oh that one i havent heard about yeah thats a typical thats a typical one thats in there the forms are right in personnel fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that its through Baxter Labs yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time every thirty days at a time well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i dont know whether you have to about an HMO i dont think so you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription and uh theyre twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year twelve dollars for a three months supply or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i dont want to say three months but its a lot cheaper allergy medicines really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe ive told you go something that you didnt know about in benefits laughterthere yeah vocalizednoise yeah i just might do that i do it yeah i you know its a very common thing its through Baxter Labs tell yeah well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it what else im sure were getting close to our five minutes whatever here yeah laughter uh lets see we discussed uh uh medical and dental what other benefits uh retirement yeah the salary continuation i think thats a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means youre really sick if you have to use that one what about vacation im satisfied with the vacation i dont know what else you know you nice to say you get another week and when im well i only got fourteen years so ill get another week when i hit fifteen uh yeah thats right so thats thats fair i mean its reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know well im uh im here ive got just eleven years and i dont think ill ever see a a silver badge i wont i wont be around that long well the way things go i think im going to have to work till im seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a parttime job ,job_benefits,2723
well i guess you said that youre youre a uh youre engaged so you really dont have a a family budget to manage right now right uh i dont have a family budget but we do have a laughterbudget laughteralready to were paying for our own wedding and everything well thats good right oh thats good so youre really planning on uh how to how to manage money from the beginning and thats a a good time to start uh weve been married twenty five years and uh we find that uh you know money management is is really important we uh dont have a lot but we still you know manage it fairly well we dont have a formal budget uh we have just found that uh by trying to practice uh paying our bills every month uh especially our credit card accounts uh we dont spend more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of that month or when the bill comes we find that that works pretty well for the most part excuse me are are you planning on having a a real budget and and setting up a monthly monthly amount to spend or uh i myself i dont do it ive been paying for my own college education also for the past four years  so uh and my parents also have been married for twenty five years and i kind of picked up what they do they really dont have a formal budget like you do and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in you know and they just make sure they dont buy over and im pretty much like that also i dont buy a lot of luxury items i buy what i need and i buy it when its on sale you know and i i dont go out of the way but my fiancee now he has a set budget that he goes by and he allots so much to each thing and it works out good for him but i think whenever like for the wedding were doing this you know the wedding money were doing together and uh weve actually sat down and wrote out how much everythings going to cost and you know making sure we have enough for everything and going from there well now then i guess thats really you know the the idea of budgeting we know you know how much moneys going to be coming in and we know what we have to spend so we dont uh you know we dont go out and spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else and uh i guess thats a budget in in a sense its its strange im an accountant and my wife manages most of the money so you know i manage other peoples money but or or you know help them manage their money so i kind of let her manage ours and then you know if theres any questions come up you know we discuss it and work things out whatever needs to be worked out uhhuh well see uh well like i said he he does computer hes with computer work and im a finance manager but uh we decided that we would kind of share like the books you know he he he doesnt like the idea that i would just do all of it and i dont mind you know him helping with it either i think its just pretty much going to be i think most couples you know its not its its not like one person doesnt know whats in there at any time you know right it yeah you you have to i think thats the the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are then theres not ever any you know any uh question about whether or not the money can be spent or whether its being spent properly or if one person knows that uh that if both parties know that what has to be spent then theres not going to be ive already said that no questions and and then plus if theres ever any uh you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to its uh ive seen it uh seen it happen where you know people been married twenty twenty five years and  one one party or the other managed the the money and you know something happens and the other one was left not knowing what was going on so you really need both of them  yeah well hes been on his own for probably oh its been four years now so he is able you know to manage  the money uh since weve decided to get married and stuff he hasnt been as carefree with his money like he used to he used to be really carefree with it and like i well my my i came from a family we my mom had twelve children and my dad didnt start out as a out as with a high paying job you know so she cut pennies wherever she could you know and i ive learned that from her and and its really helping out now because in the you know yeah in just in the in a matter of a year and a half weve weve been managed to save its going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding you know and were talking five or six thousand dollars saving in a year and a half yeah well thats great yeah so thats thats pretty good and its you know its good that youve got that that uh background of of managing and saving as much as you can with todays economy because you know things are so uncertain that you really have to watch you know be prepared to you know to cut spending when you have to but uh you know its money managements really an important thing you know with todays with the situation the way it is uhhuh and i know a a lot of couples starting out uh i dont think they really think about saving any either you know and uh now i know you know as my mom and dad thats been a big part on them and i think it will be a big part on us also but i know a lot of couples dont even think about it or retirement or you know or in case an accident would occur yeah most most young young couples starting out think uh well ive got you know forty years before i need to think about retirement so they they plan on waiting laughter you know half of that time and so they wind up when they you know twenty years later and theyve already reached that point where theyre spending everything theyre making yeah and they say oh well we have the money we might as well spend it now laughter yeah and they well they they got their uh their lifestyle geared to to spending everything and they cant cut back enough to start saving so if you cut back to start with you you know youll find youll be surprised at how easy it is to you know if you start off saving and just continue to do that yeah it is really pretty easy i mean myself im a college student and i get loans you know i i dont receive grants but i do have loans and just in the matter since uh Christmas ive managed to pay about five hundred dollars on my wedding dress myself you know and it its amazing where you can cut your pennies and you know so thats thats real good well any other anything else that we want to talk about on budgeting no i we seem to agree on everything laughter yeah laughter thats thats good every once in a while you find somebody on these conversations that you dont agree with everything have to bite your tongue but laughter well i really cant think of anything else on it well its been nice talking to you its been really nice talking to you too uhhuh byebye yeah okay thank you byebye ,family_finance,2742
um you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for um job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director and i mean its just its theres so much opportunity in a larger company to uh stay within the same company so youre not losing your seniority level but um just to try new things and and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if if you switched companies sometimes well yes you have an opportunity to  to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system its most companies most big companies have that but well i think sometime that you get lost in that also uhhuh uhhuh i really do i i i sometimes think that a small company may offer well im not sure how to put laughter well uhhuh im not sure how to put this but thats not uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise but the competition is much greater for that uhhuh well its true yeah opportunity okay there is a very uh uh at least in my office and i know thats not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office when youre with a small company i think youre right you could be even uh you can be a big person in a small company you know exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever youd care to call it and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous with the consequences of that because people do the best they can uhhuh sure and often times its not really what was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is um do you feel working working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and im you know its one of these put out fires things  so i can see the results of that i see yeah laughter but um yes i im i i get a lot of gratification from my job but some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever i i vocalizednoise but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh i i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but its nice if you can be enjoying it you know while youre doing it yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments im a im an instructor there so i teach new well not new employees but all yeah all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people to to become what we call automation specialists and and its a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job and then you would come to one of our inhouse classes that is great on on company time oh really and and and or on overtime so we dont involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week for automation specialist training that is wonderful when you finish hopefully youve acquired enough knowledge to uh you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and and and that thats really gratifying to me i i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say ive no i dont know a hammer from a a nail or a wrench laughteri laughtermean you know and okay thats and thats where well start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people uhhuh laughter uhhuh well coming in and and top notch uh mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of come they they jump right on it uhhuh uhhuh that is great and that is so smart because with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated youre just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need no thats a fact and i mean you just dont find them and it its such such a great way take the people that you already have and train them and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more uhhuh uhhuh okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job im that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they uhhuh exactly and then they had word processors and now theyve got full blown desk top publishers so you know oh my oh exactly i mean its incredible it is i im that amazes me that you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and and its i its you know they use laser printers and all that and its absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that uhhuh uhhuh but i i was in the same situation i had to learn i i had no knowledge of a computer at all im a master mechanic but not a computer expert but now im in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that oh thats great that is fabulous but um you know another benefit that that i wish i had more of and who wouldnt is vacation time you know um i think that uh when when youre working and an especially i dont know i mean every job you you say how youre constantly putting out fires you know i i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it just yeah i i i feel that way and its a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year yeah yeah exactly right and then if you have extra days out for what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it its penalized against your merit increases and et cetera oh wow so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days of what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis right uhhuh for some unusual circumstances but to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time its hard is that uh what your company policy is too well no it well in some instances yes okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then its two weeks after a year or so but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years its four weeks oh my goodness but thats still thats a long time you know but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation i was just talking to somebody about this today its funny it takes you until Tuesday or Wednesday to really wind down oh sure vocalizednoise you know to say okay i i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you dont have to be worrying about something you know i think uh i would like to see i would like to see more its like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or something and they find that thats much better for them than having the whole summer off an where theyre completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry really would really thats true benefit from that im not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so thats a problem you know thats a problem pardon me yeah well thats where temporaries come in laughter they could hire temporaries to fill in well yes thats and thats exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so we we put a lot of school um like a coop type thing for the summer pardon me like a coop for the summer almost yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on fulltime and theyve uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know theyre familiar to our uhhuh uhhuh our ways and stuff and theyre on our records and we find that thats very very helpful yeah i that is and uh it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations you sound uh like a very young person im twenty five ,job_benefits,2762
okay credit cards they leave a bad taste in my mouth uh yeah theyve sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too ive been sort of irresponsible a couple of years ago and im still paying for the the my own stupidity well the thing i hate about them i went through a divorce and i will never own another joint credit card oh youre because uh even if in the divorce decree one is agrees to pay it if youre a cosigner on it theyll still come after you if the other person doesnt if the other person doesnt and boy that thats thats a rotten deal oh id id say so and isnt it now on those those cards was it mostly her that that ran up the bills yeah about twenty thousand dollars worth twenty thousand i cant imagine any anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit card wholly smokes but uh they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it yeah thats got to be like close to what a thousand bucks a month and they said well im sorry even though the card is in her name you youre a cosigner on it and i i threatened you know legal action and everything i i dont know ive sent them a letter and i said i want this removed from from my credit rating and uh havent heard anything back but i havent run a credit check either yeah you might be worth your while to run one of them thirty dollar uh credit checks just to find out what it says but uh thats uh ill never own another joint credit card i need to find i need my credit card mostly for uh just government travel you know um uh program manager for the Air Force and uh i uh i have to go on uh travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but ive been trying to curtail my use of it to to nothing except with the exception of uh of them those type things and i also found out something else uh for your information and i dont know if youre married or not no im not but uh one of the credit cards the uh the account was paid off oh it was paid off for a couple of years never even used it and then all of a sudden i got a phone call from them saying uh uh shes behind in her payments and i said well i dont care shes my exwife and uh they said well your name is still on file as cosigner oh gee so even dormant credit cards you have uh you you have to go and send them a copy and tell them youre not responsible for any bills but uh it it can turn into a mess sounds like it so the the credit card was inactive yeah it was inactive and i never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or anything because they wasnt even mentioned in the divorce decree as to which party would pay what what when you oh my gosh because the the credit card was zero it was you know dont and it was dormant guess the the bottom line is uh you got to be darn sure youre marrying the right person when you thats right when you do that laughtertoo but uh i guess a divorce in any circumstance doesnt normally theyre either that or make or each each party have their own own uh credit card not a joint thats for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who um a girl i used to date her brother and his his wife ran up thousands of dollars in credit well i guess theyre they are both responsible for the stupid things but um had a similar situation and then it was almost like he couldnt get a divorce because uh uh i guess she didnt even work or anything and then he wouldve been strapped with everything yeah he would have been stuck with everything i remember vocalizednoise about the only credit cards i have now are are gas cards but theyre in my name only i know im about uh thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to lump everything together so that and its down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only little yeah system because uh im just i am very sort of irked at this at these credit card companies and you know they got you yeah and uh youll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your credit line and uh and it also makes it bad because you cant deduct that interest now no no you know at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct deduct all that interest and finance charges cant even do that anymore yeah i remember uh was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right well you uh this last year was ten percent this next time its zero well remember my refund on my income tax was a lot bigger uh two years ago than it was this year thats for sure yeah about only the only interest you can deduct now are is a house payment mortgage interest and uh and taxes but uh credit cards you can i cant even declare that here because uh in my situation because its uh not until i sell it the way the way it works for me because i own it as jointly with my father and uh theyve changed those vocalizednoise or its a ends up getting classified as a rental property and its not classified as a regular family dwelling so theres some reason we cant declare any mortgage interest vocalizednoise do you do you or your father either one have it homesteaded um do you mean do we do i live in it or no no homesteaded what does that mean uh in Texas uh you get a uh a big tax break if you if you call what they homestead it you have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary residence and and i live here oh oh and well that would be an interesting situation because im a resident of Pennsylvania and uh because im in the Air Force and um im living here in New York so i can i cant even vote here a property owner but i cant vote laughter thats crazy well thats only fair because the reason im a vocalizednoise resident resident of Pennsylvania is because they dont charge military income tax oh thats so so and so its like Texas Texas doesnt either at least now yeah or theyre theyre talking about instituting a uh state income tax everything else that that would bring in money the uh the the people want it but the uh the congress or Texas State Congress and so forth wont pass a bill to do it like a uh lottery theyve been trying to get a lottery vocalizednoise i think the last poll they had here seventy percent of the population voted wanted a lottery and yet the uh the House voted it down the Texas House voted it down they all they want to do is increase property taxes and put a income tax in i dont know getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best uh maybe is that even though the American Express charges the annual fee is the American Express card is it makes you pay it every month it makes you right it makes you pay it i i do have an American Express but i got it through uh TI yeah ive got a Diners Club through the government as well yeah they its a its a yeah its a yeah its a corporate they force us to have yeah uh government Diners Club and i had an American Express of my own i probably if i was smart id get rid of the American Express and get stop paying that annual fee on it but yeah and if youre late on this on my American Express they write TI since its a corporate corporate American Express that thats not good and if you dont pay it you get a call from your supervisor saying why hasnt this been paid yeah oh jeez so you dont dare run up anything on it that you cant you know that you cant pay thats thats the problem with credit cards it its people dont think of it as cash they think of it like uh monopoly money that hey i can just charge this and pay it wherever i feel like it yeah its like going oh ill have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and few other things and then youre like oh jeez laughter yeah i know that feeling laughter so i guess the the secrets not to have credit cards yeah oh well im getting to just about to that point myself so well i guess weve been im surprised they hadnt beeped in and said your ten minutes is up yeah really theyve been vocalizednoise theyve been uh even before ten minutes here lately theyve been saying you should cut it off oh really i havent i i weve actually havent timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation ends on its own or uh or that uh that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice well listen ive enjoyed talking with you yeah its nice talking to you Jerry and uh ,credit_card,2764
now we have to talk about the savings and loans scandal laughter oh my goodness do you have any strong opinions on that oh absolutely uh what are yours i i think uh its all Congress fault well i think theres a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water yep and i think the real problem wasnt the regulation which i supported but that they failed to similarly deregulate the insurance i mean i think that was the real mistake they should have seen that coming its that was like giving away free money oh sure well continue to insure insure you cheaply but you can you know do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and it shouldve been do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and by the way when you buy insurance you know theyre going to be looking at how you do it hell pay for it right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure theyll pay more for insurance uhhuh i think that wouldve been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that wouldve helped a lot would be to make certain that  the people who were going to use the money that we were providing shouldve had there own at stake they shouldve have a lot more of their own capital on the line when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and its turning out to be a lot more than that and vocalizednoise they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it absolutely because i mean their return is guaranteed they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then oh if people dont pay them back its no skin off their nose they just sure in fact theyve got a strong incentive to uh you know guarantee your money your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in you know the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is high uh because if they win they win big and if they dont who cares laughter they dont loose right yes they dont they dont lose anything well uh i dont know what couldve been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told upfront that that was was was the limit yep yep i agree with you there too uh because uh the promise is vocalizednoise this this the whole concept of too big to fail its just silly yeah the promises dont mean anything now when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have thats right and i also think the first thing they shouldve clarified was that the tax payer would give you a hundred thousand dollar maximum i dont care how many accounts youve got uh i wouldve been in a little danger of uh you know i wouldve had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return thats right and i mean it wouldve put these money brokers out of business on a CD yeah uh i dont think thatd be any great loss laughter we could do without a few of laughterthose they dont seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people which i mean certainly contributed umhum i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know its its not just the responsibility of the broker its your responsibility you know to know what youre investing in and the kinds of risks youre taking and it seems to me if youre going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limits going to be in a bank that you should be aware i mean its one thing to have insurance when youre protecting the little guy who doesnt have the time to make or the expertise to make these sorts of decisions but its another thing to be you know supposedly you would think hope that the big depositors like voters and everybody else are supposed to be educated about what theyre getting into yes you would and uh uh i dont see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i i mean in a uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that right absolutely uh there are no guarantees on them thats right you uh you trust that the broker wont sell because certain brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then youre uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under thats right yeah yeah i mean there is like for the brokerage houses there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage wont go bankrupt and youll lose your money but theres certainly no guarantee that for example uh the commercial paper that the money market you invest in wont become worthless and your and your stock price will go down thats right and thats fair enough umhum  well uh do you think that were heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry uh yes i mean theres got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because and we see reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right um so i mean this things just got to spread well i dont know how were going to bail them out because if were already how many trillion dollars in the hole wheres the money going to come from and yet the weve got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um maybe the people who uh bought term insurance arent going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i dont know whos going to bail them out yep its a problem there already there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time and the the state governor is saying that were going to protect those people but how are we going to do that where the state itself is already in hock uh were running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year and you know weve got to come up with that money because states cant run a deficit the way the federal government can and theyre going to have to be laying people off out here in the state some of laughterwhom i laughterdont think anybody will laughtermiss but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference umhum well if only it would help you know pull the usual firemen for a scam well the pay more taxes if the firemen go first yeah i think thats absolutely vocalizednoise they keep all their fancy uh perks in the legislature and they uh still do their vocalizednoise and they still have all their uh i think its something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator yeah i i came from out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people consistently voted it down and since they laughterdo laughterenough laughterdamage laughterevery laughtertwo laughteryears laughterthink laughterof laughterwhere laughterwed laughterbe laughterif laughterwe laughterlet laughterthem laughtermeet laughteryearly thats right laughterand i really feel that way about the California ones too that i i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over but anyway laughter i think constitutional congress would be probably a good idea yep i i would vote for that umhum  well its been interesting talking to you and i think were in pretty much agreement on this laughter yeah its been good yep i think so too thanks for talking uh bye bye well see you bye ,bank_bailout,2779
i guess so laughter okay ready to talk okay uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that its worked and the times that it hasnt worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit laughter laughterokay laughter tell me how yours work well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh were on the east coast now my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do thats satisfactory and weve been here seven months and hes still hasnt hit up on anything permanently oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast laughter so you see well we actually planned for about one year oh good uh thank God because it never occurred laughter really that was smart laughter it never occurred to us that it would take seven months and uh what we did was just uh decide what how we had been spending our money before and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didnt want to come down oh uhhuh and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would vocalizednoise wow thats great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of oh just our own design uhhuh uhhuh gosh and uh so but weve had budgets that didnt work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing laughterworked we spent too much money until our kids children went to college so so tell me about do you all uh have a budget well weve been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more  fun kinds of laughterthings that uh didnt really um  you know have a real strict budget but budget but uh the the about into our when when when when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just you know dirt poor then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided wed bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a laughterhouse laughteranyway laughterno laughtermatter laughterhow laughtermuch laughterwe laughtersaved and moved to Texas and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i dont know if we laughter we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least weve got a place to live um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um three and a two year old bang bang uhhuh laughter thats that that threw our budget laughterreally laughterout laughterof laughterout laughterof laughterwhack laughtertoo and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and um we just really have uh  uh i dont know weve weve tried different times weve done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went and we really dont spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like theres um times when we just have to get out where well go and like get a babysitter and well go and well blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know well i think thats important for your budget to be realistically for it to work though you have to do something yeah thats the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then its not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they dont know the difference at this age you know whether theyre Jordache new or whether laughtertheyre of course not you know laughtersomething and theyre both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each others clothes so but um thats the hardest part for us is that its really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before yeah yeah and i really believe that if youre going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down laughtersomewhat laughteron laughteryour laughterfriends on your laughterfriends thats true laughter thats true laughter well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and well end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and you know a lot of things like that that really is are hard to plan for and uh well i really do i think you have to budget those things though yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year youre going to have on extra expenses for car and exactly or know so much per month anyway yeah yeah and uh that really should be in your bank but if you dont spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the laughtermonth laughter yeah laughter our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know isnt isnt lets see now i forget which way we do it we dont list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year oh no no no no laughter you dont want the government to spend your money you want to be able so thats not a good laughterway laughterof laughterdoing laughterit thats what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didnt get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money laughter well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many years for many years yeah yeah uh and if and if thats the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it thats what you should do yeah because we dont miss it we really dont when its just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so umhum umhum but were trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision envision the uh expenses for college already you know laughtereighteen laughteryears laughteraway laughteror laughterwhatever well i was just reading an article in uh a North Carolina paper paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done i guess thats fantastic where theres a will where theres a will theres a way right yeah laughter well i have enjoyed talking to you well i enjoyed talking to you too good luck and dont spend any money this laughterweekend laughter oh i know uh well have to stay home and mow the yard laughter laughter oh boy laughter bye ,family_finance,2782
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i i guess i get my moneys worth for im not sure though whether i feel i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas isnt isnt correct well im sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go well i i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last twenty twenty years or so ive felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh theres been and extraordinary amount of money spent there and im not really sure that that weve gotten our moneys worth there uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh ive found that you know theres an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a as a given in any military operation and oh yeah no argument here yeah and i guess i i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i im im a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy i dont know i shouldnt say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh Mideast uh uh over the uh Iraqis uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe im i i dont know what other foe that would be but uh i im just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventorys going to have to be restocked uh on now i work for TI and one of the things we were told is like they had eleven thousand Harm missiles which TI is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war so theyre going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed yeah but it it it it would that be uh well lets see two thousand out of eleven thousand thats about a little over twenty per cent uh i i should imagine that that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated was was when the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being a greater one i dont think theres very much of a threat there today i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and whos controlling them but laughter that thats true thats true i i dont know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything uh that would be irrational well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks and uh uh uh TI also makes the vocalizednoise missile which was the the TV laser guided bombs and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that vocalizednoise that was that was just a matter of what what is the name of that uh its called Paveway yes yes and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also so those those are two areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that yeah well i i im what im uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that i i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that were taxed for uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i dont know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and its its a cliche i i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways oh no doubt i i i dont know uh i know im familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i dont totally agree with the the great uh uh with the with the great expenditure expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess im not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh and uh rural school systems are like i i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure yeah as a matter of fact in Texas um weve had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by the a state judge and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill which basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent that they dont have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes uh well okay to give to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds then we had a number of education reforms that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts sounds like the way the federal and state system works laughternow yeah really so so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years and uh i mean uh do you mean a a complete reversal oh complete complete its all shifted to local districts and now even the money thats been raised for the local districts is being is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state because i guess they cant raise that money in those those poorer districts huh thats right and and i have i have no problem with uh a certain uh floor level minimum level thats a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but i am opposed to vocalizednoise any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum yes i see what youre saying uh i uh i i do i i guess i am a strong uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education i mean by that i mean im a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the GI Bill so did i my Masters anyway what but vocalizednoise uh when i look at it to me uh it doesnt really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldnt have done i dont think i would have gone on unless i had that financial uh easement made possible thats right and i i dont really care what it takes to qualify whether youre uh an an vocalizednoise laughterwhether laughteryoure laughtera laughterveteran or whether you i dont even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the that that the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation would give many people who i i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of Florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the uh state land grant colleges which which isnt i mean to me it doesnt sound like a motlot of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they went from eleven to fifteen hundred and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i dont know what that would be yeah they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here a few years ago too but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess thats trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh dont have enough money so they they must charge fees uh i i im not too sure of that reasoning but i guess to get back to the main topic i dont know whether i pay too much taxes i i i travel extensively in Europe and see enormous uh people pay pay uh a great deal in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they they some states they pay uh in Germany or in in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes oh oh i can believe that but but im not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels im not sure that im not up fairly close to that well i guarantee you youd be paying a lot more in taxes if if uh the Democrats had more say you really think so yeah i really do but i mean what whats whats happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years uh my taxes have gone up they havent gone down i pay vocalizednoise uh quite a bit more taxes and and and every everybody is but thats been a Republican government for the last ten years well what what what theyve been able to do is slow down the rate of increase well i to keep it to keep it becoming from becoming even more obnoxious well this has been really interesting and ive enjoyed our talk okay uh i guess i just push something here push one again right no you just uh we just say say goodbye and thats it just hang up okay Don good talking with you nice talking with you too ,taxes,2784
okay official time well what do you think of about the budget here you first oh well i think it needs some drastic uh drastic help laughter um oh yeah i i think theres a lot of waste that that could uh that could be cut out if we could get uh politicians to be less less of politicians and um i i think it needs to be given a really high priority because i i think it has a horrible effect on the economy and and what we can do as a country and everything else i know that were affected uh directly uh at TI because of uh the defense budget cuts but i certainly think thats one of the the things that theyre doing already which is uh which which was vocalizednoise needed to be done for probably the last few years uh although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh it certainly needed i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still dont understand is uh im at work let me turn my radio off here uh is uh all the foreign aid i you know its over its a fifty years roughly since World War II i dont understand why were i understand that we support Israel and all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash rather than just selling them military things at a discount or something i dont get the idea the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year right i i have a hard time with that too now i can understand uh for instance the uh situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash to jump start their economy but i dont see where we i mean i think its crazy to be just pouring money into an economy thats obviously mismanaged for instance um well i think that we should give humanitarian aid and thats it you know i think we can loan food or or relief relief aid or whatever you want to call it but i not cash money i think you can send them wheat in other  words i think that helps our farmers but to send them money i dont i dont see under any circumstances where you send anybody money im not sure i understand the i i guess theres a a a reason for laughterthat and i i just dont know enough about it to understand the sense of it because its not an obvious i i mean on the surface theres no obvious reason why we should be doing that i have to agree with you there im amazed that neither neither party or or the which i guess theyre independent parties too why they dont talk about it i mean they dont bring it up at all why you would think theyd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other right yeah and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know yeah that theres some kind of justification there and i dont know what it is and i dont know if i agree with it or laughternot yeah i i just like to hear them talk about it you know i like to hear some of the congressmen or senators at least say well lets lets bring this before lets examine every one of our foreign aids and look like like they did with the defense with the military bases they they investigated all those rightfully wrongly wrongfully whether which ones should be closed i dont know but at least they looked at it i think they should look at foreign aid and say hey which ones do we not need to give you know right well you know the the the other thing is that you have all this this all this partisan politics where you have a person whos representing a particular state and he says well my my state it would advantageous if the vocalizednoise if the United States spent money to uh you know to investigate uh potato blithe or something you know and thats and there is tons of that and right yeah i know that is amazing and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and its and its done because some constituent vocalizednoise you know i vocalizednoise well its done because they want to impress the the people that are going to vote for him next month and uh if if there was a way to get around that and i think i think some of that could be avoided if we put uh uh a finite term on on some of these peoples um uh vocalizednoise uh you know stay in office um oh i agree with you there i i think they would have they wouldnt have time to i mean theyd have to i think their incentive would be to go out uh or and making their mark on history and they laughterwouldnt laughtereven laughterbe laughterwasting their time on little piddly stuff thats just draining draining money uh instead theyd concentrate on doing something that was significant um i would hope so anyway yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but he wanted to start another drug headquarters in his state and no one was asking for it but him and he got the money approved got it approved by tagging it on to some other bill and it didnt you know the the newsman asked him what what no one is asking for this why do you you know and it was just totally a boondoggle i mean it was just uh him wanting to build something that nobody wanted yeah sure right well thats thats you know thats the catch word these days is drug you know drug fight drug vocalizednoise i mean he got himself but the drug agency wasnt asking for it he was asking for it you know which didnt make any sense at all yeah  i dont know vocalizednoise he it looked can look good on his resume resume it is amazing how the the congressmen and senators just start are totally in another world once they get elected yeah oh yeah and well you know its like ive ive really gotten cynical i guess as ive gotten older but ive ive been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and its it just its just amazing how little anybody really says right or well duh i thought you were going to say what they do laughteroh that too laughter i ive been trying to go over in my own mind when they say were gonna really if you vote for me were gonna control crime and drugs and then they dont do anything nothing they dont have they had any president or laughteranybody every done anything against crime and laughterdrugs you know right right no i mean and because its you know vocalizednoise and its because nothing is black and white you know you just cant go up and go up there and say well were going to were going to stop crime now right yeah exactly if it were that simple somebody would have laughterdone laughterit a long time ago right exactly and thats what kind you know they theres the people that says well well well never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know its like the guy who says youre never going to raise taxes doesnt isnt realistic about what he see you know what hes doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything thats what kills me um  you know the for instance here here in Texas theyre talking about uh an income tax well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax right yeah you cant double up yeah but nobodys talking about laughterthat laughterthey want both you know laughter no i know and they never go away they just get higher and theres more of them you know exactly they never go away the funniest thing i heard lately about politicians uh joke was uh uh do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying his lips are moving yeah my favorite yeah yeah yeah yeah my favorite one about politicians is that a politicians a person whos made it to the top because he didnt have what it takes to make it at the bottom that that that that see that covers is all you know laughter right yeah but it it is the the budget thing is just and i dont know why they dont talk about it logically its always always uh again the only thing i guess theyre doing logically now is the defense which is certainly hurting TI to a degree although weve done so well with the Gulf War we got a lot of good positive press with all the exotic uh weapon systems and i think well get a lot of those you know but uh uh you you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some missiles or i mean some uh programs and all uh and theyre doing that i think thats thats really good even though it it hurts a lot bit you know yeah the the problem is that the budget is so complicated and what theyre doing are the things that are easy theyre making the easy choices well then thats probably true and and uh um and its and i think part of it is that the budget you know the the economy and the budget is too complicated for a lot of the politicians i mean they cant comprehend um you know what it takes what it needs they just dont have the expertise the other thing is they cant its too uh its not in their political career interest to make some of the hard decisions that are going to need to be made uh and so what you do is you do the obvious things you know and and they they dont really help all that much i mean sure they help some and im sure i dont go ahead i was going to say i know you mentioned it but i dont know why we cant change the laws where there the congress and the senators just have eight years or or terms because the president has it and i think that uh is you know you dont want someone in there forever and the congressmen go in there forever and thats thats their whole life then right right and their familys life and every one of their relatives gets on it has got a job you know its ridiculous well uh you know i think uh its got to come from the you know its its got to be you know there vocalizednoise certainly the politicians arent going to introduce that as a bill laughterso laughterso so you know if something like thats going to happen its usually because somebodys right there you go there you go you know somebody has gotten angry enough and has got the time an the energy to to you know have to to develop something from the from the you know ground swell level you know where you get a petition up and you you know get signatures and you call for a referendum and its not easy its not easy no thats true maybe that longterm though i think that is a a factor that is to keep the our government uh rotating you know keep them moving uh and not get the career politicians huh yeah theres uh historians i thought that keep saying will that that never was meant that the politicians would make a career it was just something that you would serve like in the military and then youd be done you know thats right well you know it and and what was supposed to be uh so healthy about our our former government is that these were regular people who were who you know these were the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants and the janitors and the uh who were in there for their brief period of time to do their to to to serve proudly and right right ,budget,2791
so how do we fix the national budget damned if i know um laughter i dont uh i suspect uh lets see  i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows you shouldnt one shouldnt say that i i i suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money and work from there that would probably be good because i because i dont think theyre very good at it that the government hasnt been looking at the source of the problem the true source of the problem is A that we do spend too much but also B that we dont take in enough yeah well why why why why do you say that actually too few Americans are working if more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor and paying taxes rather than using taxed and the tax structure was fair between lowest and the highest income Americans then we would have more money there to play with oh thats interesting yeah thats probably true i mean well we also wed be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people arent working its back in the system so youre right thats a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise revenue i mean to raise jobs i wonder hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves but in fact in some cases thats what we ought to do oh okay so start when not Reaganomics thank you but that is not gonna work uh uh what i was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space and that way just create more jobs or whatever at some point there there will be most of the able ablebodied Americans hum umhum well thats a neat idea we also need to uh assure that theres some work in the private sector yeah thats what thats what you you think space would do that much for that or i think it would do something for it i think we would fill up new technologies but i think we should also do something rather radical like what legalize marijuana oh you think you think that would uh have a major effect well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway that that might have a um a good effect on on on crime anyway yes uh okay i think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals i think it would put reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another thats probably true i think that i think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax laughter and probably a lot of and probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from yeah but thats potentially you know uh if you look at prohibition its repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues umhum um no id never thought about that then i think once we put money back into the coffers in the coffers of the federal government and get the federal government to where theres money there again we should reduce the amount of money and this would have to come rather quickly and would have to come come originally also where were not paying in some cases we do pay more for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage thats true we do often times they are paid more yeah you cant deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means thats just sensible on their part thats just what on their part im sorry i missed that its just sensible on their parts to go after the the the greater amount of income so if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage more people will get off welfare that that maybe true thats very true you know give them a true incentive to want to work and then letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure exactly where were at with unemployment right thats uh or eliminate it entirely for a few years until we get our own house in order yeah and maybe even reduce along along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well i think oh absolutely absolutely i mean we dont need to buy other peoples stuff right now thats right when were in a world of hurt well i dont im not going to say that we ought to reduce reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely right well that thats what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite heavily i mean they tax American imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get it seems only fair right it does seem only fair i mean why not and i think really if we got all those that are ablebodied into the work force the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force there would be plenty of money i i think so and then at that point quit spending on space force it all into the into the private sector oh really oh really i love the switch well at that point you might we it it it wouldnt be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be thats right we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do but i think that would be uh uh space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work is compared to defense well thats a good idea well i well the other thing and the other thing i i i think we seriously need to do is um like i say have someone go in and look and you know and find out where it is were paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something you know what causes that greed i suspect uh no your your buying large trunk the government specification sheets of paper for building a pair of BVD underwear for the federal government is twenty two foot tall if it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another for making the government issue under wear for making government issue underwear to just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines costs the company a huge amount of money well its potentially a fault of the government than i mean that could be thing like that should be i mean yes a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor right well thats a i had never heard that before a huge amount of what you hear on about the seventy five dollar hammers and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesnt come from people in the industry it comes from senators that dont know anything about it my job is government tooling specialist oh okay so you know about some of these things yeah ,budget,2794
the basic question is too much i dont know my my opinion i guess here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the uh tax day thats when you everything youve earned so far has gone to taxes the rest of the year is yours that represents about a third of your income and i dont know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third but uh i i dont know i find myself in a position sort of like selective approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh dont agree with some of them i think that we could have less tax by cutting out some of the the uh programs that we support but overall i guess were pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel well i ive lived overseas you know its with in the Army and i see what kind of taxes they pay in other countries yeah ive done some business overseas in in Latin America and of course know about the we hear about Sweden with their uh social program but you dont hear what the cost is same in Europe in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates but the it just seems as if from the time ive been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control oh yes and then they scream about that that or the uh politicians scream about theyre going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year oh yes that thats the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or uh equating it to a personal income situation and yet its almost automatic or its hidden and uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do the one of the other problems that i have recently is centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf and i realize that constant communication is necessary especially when Bush had his uh heart rhythm problem this weekend but we can always send jets for someone i think if if theyre out of pocket rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip so thats what i meant about the selectives some things i think were doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money but other things uh like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think its one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see kids of uh any background roaming through and seeing such great collections then when when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away that bothers me a lot i dont know how to solve the problem though when as you said the uh bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for the bureaucracy continues too i i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where theyve had natural disasters and going in and giving relief aid that way but paying for their these countries to run their own governments oh i think its way i ive got a big hangup with that its way out of hand im almost turning into an isolationist laughter which is not not a good attitude in in global uh communications and everything that we have this these days but its a matter of uh i hate to see money thrown away and thats what i really i equate to some of our foreign aid policies it just seems like they keep saying were helping this country or were helping that country out and they wouldnt our money be better spent helping here at at home i agree i think thats i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare thats something i would and that subject in itself id love to see that entire thing revised oh yeah yeah i i think when you get to a point where its more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job youve got a basic concept problem somethings got to change you know and turn drastically but i i think uh if were going to waste money id almost see rather see us waste it at home laughter than overseas too and that theres some unusual things which can occur in the foreign aid uh by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and thats a lot of power vested in one one person in our system of uh and ive seen that happen over the last few years and you and i are paying for it but Jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially youve been overseas and have seen other places and i guess were still fortunate but i think were just i just want us to be smarter than we are well weve got its not like this country doesnt have the people with the knowledge weve got it weve got people that are willing to make change but as long as youve got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington playing power broker theyre not going to do anything to tap tap out the well yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term no lets see i forget was it one term or two term uh incumbency in other words they cant be reelected reelected after i think maybe the second term now thats something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too two terms then they got to sit out one yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else creating the incumbent uh invincibility invincibility theres another problem with that id weve got some good ones and i hate to see them leave laughter but it i guess its hard to to really uh identify which are the good and which are the bad the electorate seems to be putting them all back in and i thought this last election would be different but it it turned out it really wasnt and i think the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesnt matter if theyre in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine theyre going to be able to do things behind the scenes either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted thats not going to slow them down at all uh it doesnt solve the non elected bureaucrats bureaucrats either thats thats an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit in the same position and really dont give a hoot who gets elected they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the the uh horrendous regulations and everything else but its uh its our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt weve got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning uhhuh uhhuh i think thats right well the question is who whos ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt yeah How do you feel about the information we get uh from Congress that that affects us as far as the uh knowledge to to elect the right people i have i have a real problem federal register for instance uh you can have almost put anything in there you want to no its not in the federal register whats the uh the congressional record uh someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or uh trying to get the um politicians to actually truthfully report what they did vote for what they didnt vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk is almost is going to be impossible to do yeah it there is no accountability of them at any given time if youve been to Washington ,taxes,2795
i dont guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies uh when i first got married was a Visa card uh issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City because my sister worked at the uh uh the Visa vocalizednoise Bank Americard center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there im not sure that i would have qualified theyve come in handy over the years  yeah uh and they have become or also a a real bother sometimes oh tell me about it laughter especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if youre on vacation its just easier to put everything on a card and uh i find if youre not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face and you go i dont remember doing all that stuff and it adds up yeah they add up quick so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh i kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases yeah we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies you know but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you dont watch it how how do you look at credit credit cards we just uh quit using them laughter and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off vocalizednoise thats we keep them uh we keep uh one gas card and uh and uh Visa just you know in case theres an emergency or something but other than that we dont use them anymore laughter  well thats kind of the way we were coming its its uh i guess for that very reason that that uh if youre not real conscious of what youre doing its just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid laughter i know isnt that funny laughter and i give them maybe not maybe theyre not really concerned about getting paid because theyre know if you dont then theyre adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent sometimes its twenty two percent interest yeah yeah and then some of them add late fees on it and say they dont get paid and i guess thats one of the motivations behind the the uh vocalizednoise the uh American Express card with TI theres no with the American Express card from TI theres no um uh uh late fee theres no uh interest rate you either you either pay the thing off or they come get it oh really and its turned into personnel and they come get you so theyve got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then oh yeah then some of the others do but thats the one that your cost center manager sees every month so youre a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to can you use that one for personal use oh yeah oh you can you can use it like any other card and uh oh i see huh but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those uh bills that come in and those statements youre not the only one you uh you want to make sure that vocalizednoise uh is that okay is that okay okay that okay those people see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is but most of the others ive sent back i mean all you get is card offers ive got three card offers now uh from gas companies and uh Visa Gold and uh some other bank uh Citibank i think is always sending the Visa stuff out and i usually just throw them away because i you know oh i do too i dont even open them much i throw them out i dont want another one i dont want to have to mess with it you know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards and uh one of these days its going to all be full a girlfriend of mine found uh uh it was a Visa or MasterCard she found the ad for one in like a Good Housekeeping Housekeeping magazine for eleven percent oh thats not bad so i said shoot i need one of laughterthose yeah no if they dont say no annual membership on them ill throw them away um years ago well that i had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for oh probably fifteen years and then they started charging uh annual membership fees and i said adios im you know im not paying you why do they do that its just another way to make money as far as i can tell i mean theyve been i mean i mean they get enough you know on the interest well sure and they i guess they figure theyve got enough people out there with cards theyre going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop theres going to be that much more uh so then a couple years ago i found uh a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership so i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my sons savings account in his name and got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee i it would be okay but i cant see paying someone to use their card be charged that eighteen percent interests no i cant either so yeah i think youre right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere yeah yeah really laughter gets a lot of people in in trouble yeah it sure does maybe theyre counting on that i dont know well i guess thats it thanks for talking okay nice talking to you

uh do you have a budget we sure do as a matter of fact i do the finances in the family and what i do is take uh entire take home pay and then i like divvy it up into sections into the house into the car into the utilities anything thats to do with the house like utilities or electric or anything like that goes into the house budget and then i have one for the food and one for um and and each of these is allotted a certain amount of money and hopefully laughter we stay within that budget and then uh we have some for uh debt and some for just plain family you know like if the kids need clothes or if um oh i dont know you know if something something in the house well the house one gets the money for the budget if we need something new in the house or something like that and thats pretty much how we do it does does it i mean does it work pretty good i mean you are you able to stay on track pretty much umhum it does uh now the way that we can really get off track is if i start to pull money from something and put it into another into another budget like if i have money put into the house budget and all the bills that go with that and i start siphon siphoning money out of that like into the food bill budget um to buy more food and i dont do that usually but when it does happen then i get into problems with you know then i have to take money from somewhere else to pay the bills on the house and i dont like to do that then you can get really into trouble and that doesnt happen very often because im pretty strict i dont usually take money from anywhere unless i absolutely have to yeah we dont we dont really have a budget per se we pretty much know what our bills are and you know ours ours is pretty simple but uh but what i do have i do have we do have a plan where we do put X number of dollars away every month both through the employment uh sectors and also privately in in an investment portfolio so that goes we take that out right off the top well thats great course the employment comes out before you ever see it but then the other stuff the private stuff we take out and then we disburse it into those uh accounts before we even start the rest but on the budget we of course we havent really gotten into trouble by not having a budget yet i can see definitely see that there is a need for one though and probably as my daughter gets a little bit older and we start getting involved in in other major purchases and things like that well have to do that uh its its kind of a good thing with my husbands company we can allot a certain amount of money and all of our we have four children each of our children have a savings account and then theres a basic savings account like a family one and what the his um company does for us is we allot a certain amount and like you said uh they take they just take that straight out of the paycheck and put it right in the savings account we dont even see that money uh we can take it i mean its well available to us if we want to take it out but uh we just try not to touch that but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings its very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings lets laughteryou laughterknow but you have to be quite um adamant and say youre not going to touch that so yeah we we have a we have one savings account that we have jointly that we can take out of if we if we decide we want something yeah  but thats the only one we touch everything else we have we have promised each other we will not touch anything else in fact like CDs and money markets and all kind of stuff weve got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it i think thats great so in case one of us decides to get weak or something like that you know say well you know if we wont miss this or we wont miss that you know uh so our our investment portion of it we dont we dont even touch it if we get low on money or we we go other avenues we dont we dont ever touch that so yeah we dont touch the kids we do have the joint one like you said and we do fluctuate money in that one if we want to and then theres one other thing that we have and and we dont touch the money in that one yeah we do the same for our daughter we have uh of course when she was born we just took you know a lump sum of money and put it in a C D umhum thats really good as one one means and then we took i take a hundred dollar savings bond out of every paycheck thats good thats goes directly for for her and then we also have a savings account which we do put X number of dollars in per month which is able to at least build her education fund you know and thats so important because today things can be so expensive they really can well if you if you really look at it the kids that are are born today by the time its college time which will be it will be cost prohibitive if if parents dont do it thats right exactly kids cannot make money that much money in in that time frame uh working odd jobs to pay for that kind of bill its just not possible to do it like maybe we did it when when we went to school and and there i dont think theres a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because i dont i just dont think its going to be there so i think if parents dont provide its its not going to be there its too hard thats right and uh who knows how much thats going to take i mean what were taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just dont know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if its if its extra yeah yeah exactly then she can go to dental school or any or anything else that she wants to do from from there so wouldnt that be great i think that all of those things are really important and and uh the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we we would oh i cant think of the word like or money would go through the cracks you know and at the end of the thing wed go what happened to all that money the extra we had the overflow you know and it just siphons itself away somewhere into the air laughter and so well you know i i you you brought up a real good point because i because i notice we do that occasionally well get it well get down and think where does all this go we just went out on a frivolous on a on a frivolous you know like a frivolous spending binge all of a sudden you know and now where did it go yeah yeah its hard to keep track isnt it it is uh uh because i know we we have gotten ourselves into that predicament a few times but weve always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we dont have a lot charged up on credit cards we dont have you know a lot of money going out i think thats great uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe youll have extra money sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important i didnt used to have uh a money allotted out for debt service until um i just had a baby seven months ago and she had extensive problems and and laughter the the specialists and the hospitals that she had to have you know uh she was in the hospital for like a month and the money that accumulated in those i found i had to make that into the budget to start paying those off and then i mean the insurance oh isnt that something i say isnt that something about medical bills golly i know just one little one little hiccup will just about devastate you our insurance was wonderful but it didnt cover everything you know and so yeah fine you have to um do some of those things and and when money is involved it can really get expensive so anyway thats about how we handle our finances and and uh that seems to work pretty well for us yeah i keep pretty extensive records on on you know what i do and i average out you know utilities and things like that i i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills ill usually project what im going to need for next month but i dont really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think its going to come to and then well see even that i think is a sort of uh a budget uh when you do that right right in some basic sense but i think a planned budget i think is is a real good idea so you just break it down in little subgroups and then you have X number of dollars what you think is adequate to pay those bills now do you save all your receipts i do we used to it got to be a great big hassle great big mess and i i just dont do that so what i have is uh a paper and uh and i put two columns my husband on one side and me on the other side uh we pay for check or else we take out of ATM services you know a certain amount of money and i write every check down for the amount of money or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it comes through uh on on the statement then ill block block it off in in a bright color so we know its gone and i can see whats left out and whats left over to come through the statement to make sure that we dont overdraw ourselves or anything but uh thats the way i do it uh receipts were a big mess for me i cant do that that was just uh too much boy i know with that you receipts for everything yeah i couldnt do that so are you are you like a coupon saver too for stores and things oh yeah oh yeah you know ive ive noticed thats a big deal i i have i save every coupon i get my hands on i just uh they are such a boon to of housewives laughteri laughteri laughtercant laughtertell laughteryou hey i mean i know its its easy to to get hooked on that stuff because i i ,family_finance,2823
well do you think were paying too much in taxes right now well frankly i think were paying too little i think we have paid too little since Reagan and them decided to cut it uh i used to get these uh surveys from the Republican Party from time to time asking if i thought it was a good idea for them to cut taxes and i kept saying no i felt like what we ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were well granted maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be uh that is curtail the spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut but uh i always felt like the Congress uh just ought to shoulder responsibilities of biting the bullet uh that they uh uh are are supposed to be able to uh you know handle shoulder and uh cut their spending and if they had uh done that without cutting taxes we wouldnt find ourselves in economic quagmire were in now yeah well i think too many people are not paying enough taxes some are paying too much uh the the middle class but the uh upper class the wealthy people are not paying enough i think the legislation that there ought to be legislation that make makes it more equitable for uh depending on how much you earn are you so you like the progressive income tax yeah i sure do uhhuh i we think everybody ought to be paying their fair share there still too many loopholes available to to get by with well i i thought they had closed most of the uh loopholes when they came out with this uh pretty well constant fixed tax type uh about the only well i know there are a few youre right about that but primarily the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your your first and second home mortgages the interest that is yeah right and that was about it now i think there are still some real estate oriented type tax hedges they cut it back on rental property income that uh you cant uh get uh tax deductions on uh say a second third fourth house that you own on paying uh taxes on on that yeah well thats where the rich see uh certainly have a second third fourth and fifth house and they also cut back on things like limited partnerships right uh in what way what loopholes then are are left that youre talking about well the maximum tax bracket is twenty eight percent right well thirty three if youre in that hump but so nobody can pay any higher than right yeah but uh uh uh i i felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax i think thats right too i agree with that because it it for for once finally with taxes having been cut it makes the little investor like myself capable if youre able to set aside a little money aside to do a little investing and make a few bucks without getting it all taken away from you and you ought to get your salary taxed once and if youre able to save some money to be able to invest in stocks and bonds and various things like that then to get it stuck to you again seems just a little bit unfair im saying the way our taxes are structured right now it does not encourage saving no it really doesnt but on the other hand how how um how would we change it to encourage saving um well that thats a good question and go back to things like tax free IRAs and like that they wound up coming back yeah i agree with that that thats i uh okay yeah i thought that was a good move too that certainly in yeah i think i wish we would do that im in a bracket right now where i cannot take advantage of an IRA getting a tax deduction on it i hear you i used to be able to do that but uh i cant now and so then theres also the problem now where ive got some contributions that were tax deductible and some that arent and i have to keep those separate and now that yeah and thats absolutely unfair i agree and it seems like every time Congress and and and uh the presidency gets a set up like the had now see thats the kind of tax cuts im for not necessarily just a a broad range tax cut on salaries so much but tax cuts where they dont tax savings of various kinds you know savings where youre willing to tie your money up at least some minimum period of time some some uh minimum number of years and all like like IRAs were uh it it that that those are reasonable alternatives that the average person can get in on and not just the rich alone but uh uh seems like every time that uh people begin to make a little money at that and a lot of people jumped on IRAs i mean you did you apparently you apparently did and a lot of people i know did too oh i still do contribute to an IRA even though i cant take advantage of any tax breaks yeah well im in one too but it seems like as soon as they uh got to going like gangbusters and the Congress saw that big pile of money beginning to form out there they wanted to come in and tax it again and and uh that thats only again because they would not uh uh police themselves and their spending and i i dont know i i dont know what else to do about it i mean seems like we are are are constantly reelecting Republican presidents and Democratic Congresses or Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses and they cant ever seem to get together yeah well i think one of the things that may maybe does encourage encourage uh saving in a small way is that you cant write off taxes on personal spending uh that may keep a again that may cause a recession as well though because it keeps people from going going out and charging their credit cards uh to the max and it cuts down on uh how much uh spending were their going to uh do for the year do you think this latest interest cut rate cut that the Fed just went through is going to uh get people back on the spending im not so sure about that uh were still uh in a recession as such and uh it that tax that cut in the in the the prime has not encouraged activity in the market yet i think people are going to follow the stock market if if it takes off uh thats a good indicator that the economy is turning around and people are going to start spending again right now a lot of people are fearful about their jobs oh yeah i know exactly how you feel there are a lot of layoffs uh you know unemployments way up and uh theyre just saving money uh until things get better uhhuh uhhuh i uh was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to think it was going to make a difference but i said hey if a lot of people are all ready borrowed up to the hilt i dont care how cut low you cut taxes they cant afford to borrow anymore or they wont just because they want to try to get a handle on what they have that you youve got to cut them drastically such that the uh idea of refinancing at a lower interest rate becomes the thing to do right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points in order to refinance a lot of people cant afford that thats right or or less the break is considerable between the the interest rates and the cut between say eleven percent mortgage down to no more than nine percent mortgage thats not enough youve got to get down to eight maybe even seven and a half yeah well thats basically what were doing right now is uh people a lot of people have eleven percent mortgages and they can get nine percent now but it costs them three points to do that and thats not enough you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that three percent of yeah three percent of their mortgage mortgage right now or or of the uh principal thats left on their loan is uh a significant chunk of change thats right and uh a lot of people arent arent in a position to take advantage of that so i i im not so sure myself that uh that cutting interest rates is going to do it or cutting taxes either i just think weve gotten ourselves so uh gone through such a uh uh period of time where weve been so credit hungry and um we have gotten uh uh so out on a limb in debt not only uh federal debt but consumer debt too that uh im really concerned whether any kind of taxation one way or the other is going to make a difference yeah well another thing that uh kind of irks me right now is i just got my tax appraisal on my house and it went up ten thousand dollars from last year uh uhhuh well you know thats whats happened to me i got my appraisal well we get them up here they give them to you three years out i mean you you get one every year but it it it puts in at a what they expect it to be for the next three years you know based on what it is right now subject to change of course and uh real estate values up here in in the uh uh uh eastern corridor have dropped about two and a half to five percent real estate values here have dropped at least ten percent over the past uh two years well see the pressures is more up here so it hasnt dropped quite as bad because the population being what it is but nevertheless its dropped but uh this hasnt been reflected in my appraisals and i was just telling my wife the other night you know i says i i wonder who it is you talk to here in the state about about protesting this because if and only uh interest rates im sorry uh property values dont come back up which means i can see that i can uh get again at least what i could have gotten for my house a year ago then im not being fairly appraised theres no justification here for an increase in uh the value of a home the property values are still going down and im not sure theyve hit the bottom yet um in the Texas area so uh when when they yes when they all of a sudden increase with all the layoffs and what not uh real estate prices have not been going up uh theres too many too many homes on the market right now too many people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them their abandoning abandoning their homes is a lot of that going on oh yes theres two homes on my street right now that sure um thats going to put the banks in dire straights because the banks dont want the property they want the money thats right there are a lot of banks that are in trouble weve had banks that have been closing for the past two years in Texas weve got a record number of banks that have been gone all ready gone under well do you see where the tax situation could really help that any uh no i dont i think thats mostly with the economy and the job market but i think its unfair that uh the tax appraisal has gone up this year when in fact the uh the value of the homes has not oh i do too yeah yeah i think its absolutely unfair but theyve gotten into this mentality and uh i dont think they know how to appraise a house down yeah i dont know how what they use to justify that uh because say ive got the same model home as some of my neighbors and theyre all appraised at the same level even though ive made more improvements on my house than somebody else has and nobody comes out to take a look and see what youve done to get a proper appraisal now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months or later if if they have the data they dont always have that much data because they may not have sold that many of your model but here they could for instance i ive had to they do it randomly more or less but they try to get three at a time over a twelve month period because uh one of the houses i sold im in my third house now i uh my second house i actually had an appraiser come out and take pictures of it uh that he had to go ,taxes,2831
all right yes yes i think were terribly taxed i i think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats and i dont think theres a change between one party than the other uh i think we get get a lot back but not as much as we should uh i guess what i feel about it is that its so mismanaged that it theres got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it its just its ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into action action the the Gramm the Gramm Rudman what is it uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that thats exactly what they needed to do to get their act together the Gramm the Gramm Rudman Act yeah yeah well i think they spend too much they they spend too much on themselves too the the oh yeah i think so too a lot of the the taxes gets back to the the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than yeah well things like mailings they dont use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they dont they dont try to uh to conserve no youre right and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and i mean when i dont have money i dont buy something yeah no i think uh it it is the the Congress and them just dont have any interest in saving us money uh they sure dont seem to the national debt is terrible uh therere a couple of things i think we need to really work for and i dont know quite how to do it but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they dont have to spend so much time doing everything if its a good idea it can be done again oh yeah you know and if its not so what at least you havent thrown out all the work theyve done for months and months and months and months yeah i saw one on Twenty Twenty uh about a month ago i guess whereas one i think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that maybe it was uh Connecticut im not sure one of the small states up there where he had a bill through for another um a drug agency that would be located there and he was the only one that wanted it it was going to cost millions of dollars the drug agency didnt want it and he was going to build it in his home town and they were going to hire a lot of people and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing and and you know they they asked him about it and yeah this is thats right do you really need this this is going to cost a lot of money oh yes we need it but do you know that the drug agency doesnt want this and they do things that are you know just like the uh yeah thats just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on and the trouble is you dont you have so little input about it you dont know enough yeah that to know what what to do about some of this stuff i right yeah theyre supposed to do what we say but they do what they they want to do really yeah thats right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i i just cant believe there arent other people out there that could do just as well as what weve got absolutely absolutely we need to get that through we we have said that ive said it several times on different subjects about the government that two year two terms is enough for all of them uh whether youre mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly President that uh two terms is plenty yeah i think thats right and then we get these professionals out of there and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us yeah wouldnt that be too bad well thats right i think i dont know i think uh people in general the the the the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that its not hardly you know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere until we cant weve just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know well its so much money and you cant even add it up you know thats why they think its vocalizednoise no you cant even cant even conceive of what theyre talking about yeah when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know yeah yeah i mean it just and and you just the other thing is its its all very well to give money to help people other people and i think we need to do that but there are they need to put more limits on them they need to restrain about what they do foreign aid yeah foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless its absolutely necessary they theyve given that away for fifty years i i you know i think thats probably unless unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again i agree i agree you know i dont really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing thats thats just uh eating us up you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family wed be up before the the magistrate laughter for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and its all right yeah i i know were taxed to death on every every thing i dont know whats the best way to do it but uh they dont even talk about that they just raise it they dont even consider it like you saying is to cut something back you know yeah thats true well sounds like they are at least doing something now with the uh the military you know theyre cutting some of that but of course now you know TI you know thats hurting us but although yeah its good to see them doing some things there anyway TI has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else and if theyll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic uh weapon systems but uh thats the only good that ive seen Congress do you know and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody uh i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens were going to have to bite the bullet and were all going to have to do it i it just isnt fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere yeah yeah thats why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into action into action and show they mean business that theyve got to cut theyve got to cut costs yeah the only taxes i think that are well spent well not the only but uh i think the now i i dont understand the present school thing but uh i have two daughters ones in college already and ones about uh to be in high school but uh i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i dont mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know yeah i think thats right well i dont i dont really mind paying taxes for for positive things that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things but um you know it you just feel like its out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than theyre doing the spending is out of control yeah oh i agree with you so its i i think thats a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh well i think thats right if they dont do if they dont if they dont pull it in and start doing something i think theyre really going to have to i think i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that what they did last election and uh ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes you know theyre supposed to represent us thats what theyre called but they dont yeah yeah maybe maybe maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are yeah in some ways were awful lucky i guess there a lot of lot of places where its worse than it is here but i know but it still you dont want it to get that bad good heavens no thats right you dont want to uh you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i dont really mind paying taxes but i would just like to know that theyre not being foolishly spent that theyre doing something thats positive for for somebody i dont really feel like uh i dont really feel like i use taxes laughtervery laughtermuch laughteri dont know maybe i do more than i i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh yeah thats youre right well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex uh in the last say twenty five years or so maybe longer theyve built all these dams you know the Corps of Engineers have uh soon as they finish a lake theyll go at get another one and that we havent had uh weve had droughts here in long summers weve had good water supply and thats due to the Corps of Engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know yeah theyve done some good things the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago uh Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that bout what they had done and they they really had done some good some good work yeah i think anything for water supply like vocalizednoise California should do more of that too yeah there are a lot of places places where theyre in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they dont take if they dont take that early stand right they just finished Joe Poole Lake over here and they need to start another one i think every time they finish one they ought to just have another one in line the waters critical yeah thats probably right the growth is fast enough so that they cant afford to just dawdle and wait until something until they need them well its good to talk to you okay yeah how many calls have you made oh about nine oh yeah im up to twenty are you a TIer no i just vocalizednoise just a housewife i just heard about it and found it fun laughter guess i like to talk thats laughterall oh well great great okay laughter well its been some interesting subjects yeah right laughter thanks for calling byebye uhhuh bye now ,taxes,2839
well what are your did you like do you use credit cards uh not very often i usually uh the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month huhuh so it doesnt gets uh uh the credit uh i have uh uh uh interest rate is so high that youre really if youre going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think dont you otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that its hardly thats right uh its not a very good idea do you have a lot of credit cards well i have a lot of them but i dont use them very much though i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh tuition if its you know if im short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require oh yeah just goes on and on which is what they want i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they dont have the money then they arent going to have it in a month so yeah thats true they uh make the mistake of pushing all their cards there are times when its when its very useful like uh emergency trip yeah yeah or something sometimes when you when you the the money will be available but its you know not immediately handy i think uh theyre very helpful plus the fact that its helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes but uh i you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble  yeah i made that mistake when i first got a job and thats kind of like it took me quite a while to pay them off after after that i decided well im not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would pay them off as we go so right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances the other thing about them is too if you really dont you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and havent developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or thats true yeah a car so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary laughter system over the last few years but uh its true you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them and uh poor thing he comes home very depressed every laughternight laughter because the world has so many problems of that sort so its uh its uh its a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to to treat it uh so that its so that its a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage right i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year but now its like its punch money because right it doesnt do you any good now does it right you cannot right you cannot write off your interest even before it probably wasnt though because you didnt get anywhere near as much as what it you didnt get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying so well im not that uh other than that i dont have too much on credit cards but its good to talk to you yeah you too thanks for calling bye uhhuh bye now ,credit_card,2883
 excuse me laughter oh go ahead Ken so Ken how do you do your family budget well we dont actually have a budget budget per se what we do is uh sort of maintain a normal checkbook you know like everybody in the world does i guess and occasionally it actually balances and then um we also we um we have a a US Air Visa card and then every every dollar we every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage oh yeah its a real good deal actually if you charge a lot so what we what what my wife and i have taken to doing is charging everything in sight anything we buy we charge including groceries and so forth so what well do is well then you just pay it off at the end of the month right we actually maintain a we have a savings a savings we have we we we have a checking account that we treat like a savings account scratch that we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account and so what we do is we anytime we do it or make or charge something we write it out as if we wrote a check and then at the end of the month all the moneys there covered already so we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything oh thats a really good idea it keeps us hopping laughter yeah see now id never get my wife to be able to follow that before we got married i had money in the bank i owned my own home i put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know and uh after i got married no it just didnt work anymore uh she spends a lot she likes to spend on anything and everything laughter with body lotion laughter everything so we really havent uh we dont have a good organized system yet maybe after awhile ill rub off on her or something laughter i dont think laughter well you know you know whats you know whats always good is sort of a force savings where they just take money out of youre pay we did that for awhile where um we actually still do it with with my wifes salary where we put it we have a separate a a a third account even um i mean a savings account in an in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week im a graduate student uh oh really in what field yes so am i yeah uh well uh in information systems im a voice researcher oh okay im in uh i i work in psycholinguistics actually um but my wifes has a real job yeah and what shell yeah laughter so what we do is we take money out of her out of her paycheck each week yeah so does mine laughter and and put it it it goes directly into another account that we dont at at a at an entirely separate bank that we dont have access to so easily and it it goes there and it stays there and it builds up until we need it for something yeah see i think we might have to do that laughter because she looks at what she brings home each week i its going to be really hard for her to uh not have her own money because like now you know i put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years and now she wants to go back to school but she saved enough maybe to get her through August you know and thats it even and i keep saying now Laura youre going to have to save a little money i dont know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through it doesnt work Ken laughter my mother always said dont argue about money so we dont right thats the thing you you you dont argue about it uh but uh but you know uh there goes my savings laughter but you know i its one of those things its oh God oh God yeah i i got lucky my wife apparently is is is not a she likes to spend but shes pretty good about things yeah now see my wife will do things like make clothes oh wow uh you know one of our one of our big investments that you know was i was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine because she makes clothes and you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and and shes already made you know presents and gifts and things for shorts for me and things for the summer you know so i guess i cant you know weve probably almost paid off the sewing machine with uh thats great with the money savings there yeah the savings from that so i cant complain too much you know she shes good about that and also we we dine at home a lot you know she likes to cook so that saves us from restaurants or whatever but thats good but she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money money dumped down a drain you know right well i guess we all have those things though i mean i uh i uh  i i go to uh i pay what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know for the you know i pay up through the year yeah but you need a hobby right exactly so you know that but that to her is sort of a waste but but she does her nails so yeah thats true yeah laughter i know and those nails are so expensive i know laughter oh gosh i was so excited when she decided she wasnt going to do her nails anymore i guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow and then she waits for them to get their color back and then shell polish them again i dont know whatever so she stopped for awhile boy what a difference they buy nail polish every two weeks its laughter uh gosh and lotion oh my goodness body lotion oh yeah we spend more on on soft body on on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things uh she must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year and so yeah laughter good old Ivory um well it its for your benefit though right thats what laughter yeah its funny oh i think so shes always soft thats true vocalizednoise always soft vocalizednoise you know uh so so thats helpful yeah yeah yeah but i i think um i dont know maybe after uh were not in school anymore well be much better at saving i think uh i think thats uh now do you still own a house you said you owned one i sold my house and thats whats really paying for my uh time unemployed or whatever you know because the graduate assistantship really doesnt cover the ten thousand dollars in tuition really doesnt cover living expenses oh thats great uh now well we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job so that makes it hard um with you know were paying double rent and double utilities oh wow and that makes it sort of expensive but see i live within my i live within my meniarmenial menial laughter very menial income and she doesnt laughter she doesnt live within her her professional income you know so i just get a right there thatll kill you thats the killer two apartments and stuff like that yeah and and then even if we want to see each other on weekends its twenty five thirty dollars in gas every weekend and that really adds up too you know so it uh it gets tough but i well thatll kill you yeah i think well do much better when were living together and were only paying one rent and one telephone you know well itll cut our telephone bills eventually right i mean youre not you know yeah by five by four fifths you know if if if shes here so its its actually tough this year but itll be better in June shell be move live together in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then right my God have you been married for long or no just since December oh wow so you guys really are newlyweds yeah yeah were vocalizednoise very newlyweds and but thats the you know we were together for probably um oh wow uh very close for about six months before we got married so you know we lived within uh though i owned held had my own house and things you know we still uh were still pretty close and i knew her spending habits and and theyre about the same they havent changed at all you know laughter my mother always said to me Tom now the best thing to do is be like youre father never say a word when youre wife spends money and i was like well thats true my dad never said a word you know yeah so i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes because i think you know um i sort i sort of feel guilty if you laughterknow given that she makes twice as much as i do so i sort say you know if she wants to go out and buy something i never argue with her because shes vocalizednoise shes real good at you know sort of saving and um yeah i dont i dont argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face you know must be like  like must be cringes or something you know um especially like yesterday or this past weekend we met half way between at uh at her parents house and um she had on a new pair of jeans and shed gotten all new underwear and i was like  Laura laughter how did you get all this stuff she goes well i just got paid and laughterand i was like oh had the money in their pocket yeah yeah it was there it was burning it had to be spent you know but she said everything was on sale and im like oh oh thats good at least it was on sale thats good honey im glad you bought it on sale laughter what else can you say thats right i do recommend the force savings bit the uh they take it out of your paycheck before you see it because then it doesnt hurt yeah i think yeah you dont notice it i think thats probably a really good idea you know you dont even think about it if its gone you know so uh until you really need it and then all of a sudden you realize youve got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else you know we managed do it that way yeah see i i was when i had when i was living alone and i had my own house and things uh you know i put one i was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage and the food bills and it and i was even able to you know to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account because im pretty thrifty and you know but my wife likes to spend she enjoys so thats fine laughter but uh for savings ill have to look into that yeah thats just that and that uh that has been our godsend you know we had weve had some sort of major emergencies come up you know where um we also own our own house um we had an ice storm up here recently yeah yeah where it was it was pathetic i mean it was horrible i mean half the half the city owned trees or or or or half the one third of of of all the vegetation in this county is just wiped out oh really because of the heavy ice yeah it just it just weighed exactly it broke the limbs and our um we had to trim our backyard that tremendous willow tree that is it fortunately we didnt have to bring it down all the way but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it still not all of it they dont get you know and that plus and then we had a car expense like that same week one of the cars died you know all those things then they add up and that force savings really comes in handy then yeah yeah i can see that thats i keep trying to say to her you know Laura dont spend so much what happens if something happens to a car you know shes oh well itll you well nothingll happen ooh ooh i always just shut ,family_finance,2884
well i think health care is real important and dental coverage but i guess medical insurance is probably what i consider the second most important yeah i agree on that and you know it seems paid compared to what we our salary is versus what our health care is our health care keeps increasing increasing increasing and not to the same rate as our pay laughter right right i know no matter what you do about that yeah unless youre like a Senior VP or something which i am not laughter yeah i know its um i dont know and then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people right me either  um expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level you know theyll say maybe well pay you X amount annually but then we you know ten percent to fifteen percent more is are your benefits and if youre like are you married um like my husband works and i do so i dont take some of i have certain things that i take and he has other things he takes so i mean in that kind of situation its really almost redundant you know so that some of the benefits i would rather have um uhhuh yeah money instead i mean yeah more money actually um or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know right i feel same way actually um we dont use any of TIs benefits other than i i buy bonds and  and um thats it because you dont use the you dont use the medical insurance you use your your companys not at all my my husbands yes we use my husbands but he he works for Bramalea Company and they pay one hundred percent where does he work if you dont mind me not one dime is deducted from his check oh youre kidding whats the name of that laughtercompany what do they do laughter Bramalea its a security company and and building they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings  and uhhuh are they a big company or yeah actually theyre from Canada theyre Canada based uhhuh thats see thats probably why because Canadian Canada has the the um government run health care systems social medicine and you dont pay them and if you live there its like Europe you dont pay a dime right right yeah its all taken care you know thats wonderful yeah but vocalizednoise our prescriptions and everything our visits to the doctor our hospitalization the only thing we pay for is if if something happened emergency and we had to have an ambulance its twenty five dollars  laughter yeah if i were him id tell him make sure he stays there laughter i mean thats nothing compared really yeah well at TI i was getting for the both of us it was like seventy five dollars a month oh my goodness you know deducted for an HMO yeah yeah i dont work at TI my husband works at TI but um i work at EDS but its like um uh you know theyre both bacallybasically EDS is a little bit better than TI but um and we take my dental my my dental his medical and the medical is just i mean i think its terrible you know its eighty twenty but theyre then theyre getting ready to change it again for Aetna um i dont know i just dont think companies um they want you to feel responsible and dont abuse the medical system and you know um TI just did the thing where with the smoking premiums we dont smoke but did you do you know about the smoking premiums yeah do you guys smoke oh yeah i mean oh yeah yeah we dont either neither one of us do but then you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for TI too and she said what about the people that are walking around and i hope uh i dont you dont sound like youre in this category but i mean for extremely obese people or something the kind of people that cant sit in the airline airplane chair you know you know whos going to croak first the people that smoke or you know seems like an unnecessary penalty yeah i mean im not all for smoking at all but i just you know i dont know how they can do it umhum exactly yeah exactly you cant charge more for a person whos on a flight just because theyre larger yeah  vocalizednoise blanket yeah umhum or something yeah its like stupid but thats why im not a boss i laughterguess laughter i dont know laughter yeah i mean i dont know um what other what other type of benefits do they have that i mean Canadian based companies vocalizednoise companies they have to be a little bit different than the American then yeah they are as far as their like pension plans i think theyre vested a lot earlier i think at TI its what five years yeah TI is at least five years yeah yeah five to seven and theyre vested after their first year totally totally vested and they have the K and the usual benefits like that uh oh my goodness thats kind of nice yeah TI has that but thats a pretty standard thing anymore you know um your husbands company probably matches more than TI though right right no they match the same amount yeah well they match four percent which is the same you know fifty percent or four percent oh they do okay but thats yeah it is thats still pretty good though i mean the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension yeah i know um EDS has eight years i think EDS has seven to to eight years so its like TI in that respect you know and and i mean and im working for a company thats making money laughter you know EDS has a cash flow problem as they say but um not EDS TI um yeah yeah but i i dont know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire some uh vocalizednoise people the grunts as i call them like laughtermyself to tell them yeah i mean i dont know but if i were to rank them i guess i would say next to income its really just health benefits and then um for most people i know it would be day care like TI has no day care yeah that and i know thats a big issue because i i belong to a womens forum group and some of the questions were getting are are on site day care and things like that that they consider a very serious benefit and i cant tell you anybody right now at TI thats uh considering that oh i dont i would think so yeah because my husband yeah they really should because theyre big enough um so  they should be though and the other thing i think is really good is that EDS is much better than TI at i think right now that that we have day care um they uh the health the health the health program like TI has Texans but it i dont think it that its uhhuh right developed as much as it could be for the size company as TI i mean if you ever walked into EDSs health quote unquote health clubs on site laughter and you walk into Spring Creek well Spring Creeks better than the one on Dallas Parkway but i mean yeah but yeah a lot better EDS is much is better than Spring Creek  yeah oh its really nice yeah you know instead of like six um treadmills youve got like twenty laughter and EDS cant even compare in size oh man oh yeah in terms of the number of employees so i so i dont know i guess its just where they um and like EDS reimburses you for adoption people yeah oh i see right and TI doesnt have anything like that you know so i guess i i wish the companies like TI and a lot others were more progressive in that respect so thats good thats a fortunate thats a fortunate benefit you know that theyre so active for their employees yeah yeah and theres i mean they have some strange things i mean they have very strange like dress codes and you know um umhum um you cant wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless youre in a you you know but it just doesnt there arent manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is um i dont know i i guess i also wish that uh companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews me too uh me too because you know with utilities and and homes that are uh price of homes has went up drastically drastically like an average house is now a hundred thirty thousand oh just yeah exactly and and that is unreal because weve got people out here that are just  poverty level but then we got these million dollar homes so you know where do you find a happy medium and how does your salary deal with that its not its just not doing it i know i know umhum and i mean i mean i dont know how you and your husband are too but i mean we have friends that laugh at us and we i clip coupons and i said hey ill probably do this even if im a millionaire which i wont ever be but i mean its like because you just cant i mean it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something laughteryeah laughteryeah well the car insurance is due laughter i mean its yeah its kind of i know i dont know what were going to do laughterabout laughterit yeah you want to rob a bank no i didnt say that laughter i didnt say that on this line laughter thats true that is exactly where we are thats so strange  common problem common problem laughteryeah laughterreally i dont know what else about corporate benefits i cant think its probably been too hot today for either of us to um kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas usually people are all over the country yeah and i think Dallas as far as um economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is um this is true so were somehow were better off than a lot of them umhum and that doesnt doesnt make it any better its just i guess something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um thats what i want that uh you know people are lucky to have jobs and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits no laughter when you see people that dont have um anything but HMOs or you know i mean really cant even afford to get in a job that costs like we had a guy fixing our air conditioner and he said he didnt even make ten dollars an hour and he has three kids and i went oh you know that has to be rough but benefits i dont know i guess i guess one thing id like to see too and i i dont know how TI is about this but id like to see um employees rank and file be able to contribute more to their um the execution of their job yeah empowerment issue  you know right yeah thats a good word for it um how is TI in that mode well very well um its slow though i think at least theyre making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and cultural change within the management first and now its kind of filtering down to the peon level but uh i think theyre really trying its going to take years though i mean its just its that mindset all part of a good old boy network yeah umhum has to change yeah  yeah EDS is oh theyre better but theyre a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do theyre pretty much put the if thats where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know theyre kind of formula oriented doesnt want to change yeah and and you cant really argue with them because theyve always been successful so you know what can you tell them laughter really well i guess thats what i know about benefits okay laughter okay yeah me too good good talking to you thanks okay byebye you good talking to you and uh keep cool okay byebye ,job_benefits,2887
what do you think about the benefits in jobs um im im relatively relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive id rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less laughtermoney but um you know thats thats my major complaint i guess what about you yeah and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you paying for all of it or or maybe that its not understood what should be covered and what isnt yeah i right the the health insurance i have is MetLife and if its the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay ten dollars and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty i see now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is what theyve been doing is they they poll somehow the area and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code and so recently when when we had a claim um they didnt pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well thats because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because either there arent that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out or their you know their statistics arent very accurate right and and theyre probably doing it to their benefit anyway so yeah i would assume that you laughterknow whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in but its its difficult What about other other benefits are there others that youre dissatisfied with well i work for Sears and and um thats about the the only real benefit you have is health insurance well you have vacation i mean yeah yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like uh TI and some other places you know they have social recreational facilities and they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and i dont know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that yeah im not familiar with that sort of thing but but you know to me vacation laughter is is an issue and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um um i dont know i suppose um sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill but um otherwise im not not aware of any problems with the benefits around here so maybe that covers the topic then yeah well i dont know the working the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits some places arent very safe to work and and some places dont compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under uhhuh or maybe a benefit uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls right uhhuh um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others yeah i think so and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules but other than that i dont have much feeling for laughter for the benefits since like i said um i dont have a big problem with with them i um Workmen Workmens Comp is a big thing now in in Texas because um um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh and i dont know besides that but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing oh i uh i didnt know that somebody could avoid Workmens Compensation well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state oh i see so apparently it costs less that way uhhuh uhhuh i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits its to the to to the benefit of the company laughter and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think that they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them yeah thats what i what i think they they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are and how much profit theyre making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i dont see how they can save money uhhuh uhhuh you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them thats right no i agree yeah okay it was nice talking to you well thank you for calling byebye yeah byebye ,job_benefits,2897
uh do you work yes i do what do you do uh im a data manager at a manufacturing company that makes landing gear oh well do they have good job benefits yes they do very good uh comparable i used to work for TI and i used to work for Martin Marietta and they are comparable to them um as good or better what do do you work no i dont oh okay uh i said my husband works on the railroad theyve got a lot of benefits but its expensive this uh the insurance is a kick in the tail every month well i uh my insurance is is very reasonable where i work and course the it would well the insurance is good we only have to pay like a hundred dollar deductible per year its just its uh its like a hundred dollars a month oh is it really yeah well i mean well thats just well i i chose an HMO and mine only runs five dollars a uh five dollars a month well this is uh like retirement benefits and its a bunch of different benefits in one its not just oh i see its not just medical insurance okay well i pay five dollars a month for my medical and then we have a retirement uh benefits package a profit sharing type of thing they match our uh we can put in up to fifteen percent and theyll match uh sixteen six percent one hundred percent you know so that is thats better than most companies do thats great yeah thats good plus plus they you know we have bonds we have a credit union its a fairly its not a real large company well it is its part of a large company its a subsidiary of a large company and  whoops im sorry we have three different thats my calls waiting theyll just have to call back uh we have uh uh were part of a im sorry company in  we have a company in California and a company in Canada and this company here and uh so we have about five hundred employees at each place they do uh so its thats about fifteen hundred all together then we but were a a subsidiary of a of a larger company so we have all the benefits that all the big large companies have i dont know any that we dont have i dont know a lot about benefits most of the jobs that ive had you know were  i dont have a degree i quit college when i first got pregnant with my little boy oh uhhuh i plan on going back  just i want to wait for my kids to grow up now and uh uh im sorry laughter so all ive had was mainly fast food jobs and i worked at a toy store and i worked at TI for a while but it was for Manpower so thats all right oh uhhuh  i liked working at TI i worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Florida and worked at Martin Marietta in Orlando for four years and then i got oh youre in Florida i was no im in Texas uh i left Martin Marietta for this company here in Fort Worth its im in Grapevine right now but oh okay i work in Fort Worth and they just offered me such a fantastic deal i i just couldnt turn it down there wasnt any way i could turn it down they they moved me and they paid for every i mean they paid for everything my license my drivers license my all my utilities at my home plus you know paying to move my furniture and my license tags everything i just you know and plus a huge salary increase and i thought God id be stupid if i dont take this and i wanted to come back to Texas anyway so  well thats great and like i say they have all those same benefits that Martin Marietta and TI had so um what did you say you did again a computer a data im a data manager and it well i took data processing in college oh did no this is a lot of people think that it has something to do with computers and it really doesnt i mean i do have a computer but it it really doesnt have anything to do with computers its data that uh is generated like reports test reports financial reports all kinds of reports that that uh a project would generate uh now its my job to see that contractually contractually these people you know deliver them on time and i have to make sure that they they do get delivered and thats thats what my job is and its thats that kind of data instead of instead of computer data well that sounds great though what did you do at TI yeah uhhuh i was a a configuration manager at at TI which was similar well it was uh similar but wasnt i mean i it was uh doing uh it was a little bit more technical configuration management management its a little bit more technical than what im doing now and i liked it but it was a it was a job that i always felt like i didnt have control of you know what i mean i never felt like id mastered that job and when i moved to Florida i moved down there as a configuration manager and stayed there from uh stayed at that job for quite a while until i got an opportunity to go into data management which i and ive been in that ever since and love it i mean thats just my cup of tea the configuration manager was oh i hate to feel out of control of anything oh i do too and i really did id sit there and you know when people asked me what i did i never could really tell them what i did because i didnt know because i you know laughter i was doing the job laughter you played it by ear and i was getting good raises and my laughterboss even goes you even got non periodic raises but i really just felt so control out of control so but anyway im and i like i say ive always been with a company thats had a lot of benefits so uh and and when you get older now i know when youre younger my daughter just doesnt realize it but i wish i had when i was younger thought about retirement but you know you think oh thats twenty years away from now whos going to worry about it well i well me and my husband are weve talked about it were having six dollars a day taken out of his check for retirement thats good thats smart i wish i could talk my daughter into realizing that she works at TI also well thats and she needs yeah at the TI in Sherman or no she works at the Expressway site uh SC Building okay well uh um thats about the only thing were doing for retirement now when i worked i wanted to go to TI i was wanting to become a TIer that way i could get some benefits because most the jobs around here you cant get benefits i know isnt that a shame especially if you well if you dont have a degree or something but ill go back to school one of these days and i will get me a see well i was uh forty five before i got my degree i uh started back when i was it took me nine years i was about thirty something before i even went back to school or even started college and i was forty five when i finally graduated well i was eighteen and i went and got my GED i quit the high school i just couldnt stand it and then course i hated it two years after i quit i wish id never done it oh yeah but then i i went and got my GED and i went to school and then i i loved college i was making a three point oh average i wasnt having hardly any problems except for with my computer class i did have problems there but uh now i was then i was old enough to know you know well im paying for it ive got to you know do something with it but then i wanted to stay home with the babies so yeah i stayed home with my kid i think i guess the longest i ever stayed home was eight years i stayed home with my kids and uh my son went ahead and graduated from college and my daughter has quite a few hours but she bless her she and her husband are you know kind of struggling hes a policeman vocalizednoise theyre both having and she works a second job too so she really doesnt have time i guess if she wanted to make time she could but and eventually i think shell go back when it really means something to her but right now thats not foremost and her she likes being with her little girl well were having a hard time right now too but its just who if the kid if kids dont have direction if their mother aint home directing them through the day kids are growing up wild nowadays oh i know it i know it my mom had to work and i i can feel the difference um a lot of well my husband had somebody to push him his mother was able to stay home with him more and you know he got his life straight at an early age which im not a i never i never went wild or anything but i still dont know what i want to be when i grow up and im twenty seven years old laughter i know laughterit laughterthats laughterme i here am i in my fifties and i still dont know what i want to laughterdo but my my mother didnt work she was always home so and it vocalizednoise didnt i guess really looking back knowing that she was always there when we got home from school my mother was there and what i did when my kids were growing up since i had to work i worked nights i was home i was sleepy but i was home when they got home from school yeah thats whats important isnt it you have to while im when they start going to school now my babys just three months old and im not having any more so im going to be there for them at least until theyre in the second well until the baby starts preschool uh kindergarten not preschool which it dont take long it seems like just yesterday that my little boy was born and hes fixing to go to school next year oh is he yeah theyre all growing up your your husband works for the railroad you say yeah he sure does oh now do do they have pretty good benefits there besides uh yeah their medical and dental is real good and uh like i said they do make it easy for you to thats where a lot of our money is going is toward his retirement but i want well like that once you know we get older is it sure oh yeah absolutely and well need it and like i said thats six dollars a day and oh i havent really sat down and figured it out but i guess itd be pretty easy three times six is what eighteen yeah so its a hundred and eighty a month oh once i did well yeah thatll add up fast fast fast absolutely yeah youre smart in doing that i would never quit that no well its its like this we dont see it so we dont really miss it well ive started uh thats right that i went the other day and had them start taking some money out of my uh savings my checking at work to in to put into savings account plus i buy a two hundred dollar a month a bond a month so theyll and theyll stack up faster than you realize yeah now i wish they had that bond here i know that they had that at TI for the TI ,job_benefits,2911
well i think we pay too much in taxes laughter how about you well i think they waste what we pay excuse me i think they waste what what all the money that we pay yeah thats what i think too i dont know how you feel um we moved here from another state weve lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax and what you find out is theres one evils the same as the other here you dont theres no occupational tax but its a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going no its even its even higher in Dallas County so was it yeah its really i know its just um eight and a quarter i think yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and thats eight percent i said eight percent laughterwhat so its really kind of sad yeah and then i dont know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if youre strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst is that what you think yeah because it different at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they dont have to pay sometimes they have to pay even less taxes doesnt seem quite fair does it because they have the money to shelter things and i dont know somehow get a huh no it isnt oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we cant you know that make dont make that kind of money i dont know i mean if theyre in business and and theyre making money i i could see if theyre losing money but theyre making money then they should pay taxes then umhum i know and just somehow it doesnt seem you know and and theyre not you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh whats his name Willie Nelson i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody he didnt look that stupid why didnt he pay his taxes you know right umhum in a way its almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you i just file federal income tax every year and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much yeah i just got divorced so im single again so and you know its its its a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and theyre married that umhum and we right now we dont own any property we lease so were in the same we dont have children so were in the same kind of its not as bad as being single and divorced but its sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesnt even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean theres actually less tax implication if i dont work full time compared to what my husband does you know so its kind of hard whoever works less they get a tax credit for that excuse me if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that umhum right yeah otherwise youre just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or laughtersomething well its two thousand now yeah for everybody oh it is oh oh my well thats not too bad then you get a you get a child care exemption but its not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like well i think its about five or ten percent of that you know it doesnt even its not even  oh my goodness  yeah i guess thats my call i guess i better laughtergo oh okay okay well it was nice talking to you uhhuh byebye  nice talking to you byebye  ,taxes,2915
i dont think ive ever met anybody that thought they were paying too little taxes laughter i laughterhavent laughtereither i know i pay too much but laughterso so i assume that were going to agree that we all pay too much taxes right laughter but then the question is are we getting what we pay for and and i think we dont i i agree i agree i think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects absolutely i vocalizednoise fortunately we dont have state income tax i know you guys do and right well i lived in Texas for a long time so i was really hit hard by the nine percent California tacked on to the governments and its heading that way though oh gosh well i think in within the next few years were going to have it here theyre trying i know Texas uh just raised their sales tax again because uh i was visiting in Houston over Christmas with my mother and uh uh i went bought a few things and i think your sales tax is higher than ours now yes i know were just taxed probably is im telling and i pay enough in i pay income tax that some people make and it really just tears me up i cant laughterbelieve how much i pay but and for for what laughteri laughterdont laughterknow laughterwhat laughteri laughterget laughterfor laughterthat well i really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted on unnecessary unnecessary uh bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things i do too i do too i know there are we have we have uh hundreds of thousands of dollars going to uh people to supervise people who supervise people who supervise people and when it all comes out they dont do much supervising anyway you know and i know it or uh uh who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly and why do we have to laughterhave you know laughter well actually as a matter of fact that sort of research i think is worth spending some money on because the uh basic research really is whats made our country uh get to where it is in its ability to compete and i dont mind spending on on defense either uh that doesnt bother me at all course i work in a defense project company so laughternaturally laughterim for it but well i you i dont mind spending on defense for things that work but i mind having people uh uh people spend money to create five thousand pages of documentation to order something yes right right and you know those companies that that say they you know the this is crazy uh seven hundred dollar six thousand dollar toilet seat in reality it probably really does cost that because of all the paper work the government requires that you have to go through to make that toilet seat to sell it to them it probably does cost six thousand dollars yeah i think the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate expenditure given what the government requires of the manufacturer the manufacturers probably not making very much profit on that laughterprobably laughterno and no no but the probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to uh ridiculous kinds of of paper work and supervision uhhuh umhum umhum i know absolutely um are are you familiar with the Grace Commission no what is it well i dont remember exactly when when that started but it was back in the early eighties i think uh Peter Grace of WJ Grace and Company was uh appointed by i believe Reagan to um create a commission to investigate government purchasing and expenditures and see if there wasnt a way to save money and he came uh he and his group of course he didnt do it but he got people to do it came up with a a whole books worth of recommendations for making the government run more like a business and he said that you know the the kinds of things the government does even in renting space would drive a business bankrupt umhum umhum and uh people purchase things because of the rules that require them to buy certain kinds of things in certain ways that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um you know deal like a business and uh get things in quantity that will uh you give them a discount they ought to pay their bills on time one thing the government does is is stretch out the payments so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment right i know that anyway there was this whole book that came out and i read some excerpts from it and every single thing they recommended was so laughtereminently laughtereminently laughtersensible and and laughteri laughterknow they just it just astonishes me that we have not put more of that into practice i know it i know it just mind boggles your mind when you think think and its its scary to think that these guys are up there running running our laughtergovernment that that approve of all this stuff and everytime and everytime the uh Congress changes and people move offices they redecorate the whole office they spend half a million dollars on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been redone less than three years earlier i know it isnt that sick isnt that thats our tax dollars and then they come up with these crazy projects to do things like spend seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welks birth place a shrine laughteri laughtermean i do not need a national park around Lawrence Welks birth place i dont laughtereither and i can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred thousand dollars i know it but you know what can you do theres really i dont even i really dont what know what we can do about it uh the ways to other than well i dont think it does much good but i write my Congressman all the time ive got a congressman who is very concerned about uh uh irrational expenses and who is a real fiscal conservative umhum umhum thats good and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me uhhuh well thats good and uh i dont know that its going to help any but if he got uh if if a lot of Congressmen get that kind of input from their constituents maybe theyll do a little something umhum something be done maybe laughter yeah thats a key is maybe i know i uh i donate to work we have uh a thing to you can donate but of course what were donating our uh political party that were donodonating donating is whoever is is for the defense department you know of course our defense budget thats who our money our money goes to we really dont have any say so well im in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have i wouldnt either three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services its just dumb yes yes thats dumb theres no reason why we shouldnt have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them interchangeable absolutely i just whats wrong with that i then the same spare parts can laughterbe laughterused laughterin laughter in uh Air Force planes and Navy planes maybe laughter thats laughterright yeah yes i know i cant understand but i know our company my property tax goes up all the time im right at DFW airport so were we oh yeah we should be getting a tax break because we get all vocalizednoise the town i live in gets all of the uh revenue from DFW because its in our city limits but it doesnt all its  theyre just building these great big fancy homes and uh uh taxes are just going up and up but course my property the value of my homes going up too so that doesnt hurt thats always good laughter well thats good but thats thats small comfort because it doesnt bring you any income until you sell it thats true laughter laughteryou laughtergot laughterthat laughterright laughter now we dont have uh property taxes going up as much as you all do because we had proposition thirteen that says uh once you have had your house appraised then they can only raise the taxes laughter you got enoughs enough  i believe its two percent or maybe its three percent a year uh until you sell and then its reevaluated thats great oh okay well thats a good idea uh and thats that helps people on fixed incomes and older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but who dont want to move out of them yeah i keep reading where they say in in now Los Angeles area where the the property thing is just going to bust one of these days you know or and San Francisco too i think the prices prices of real estate is so high well the prices are so high i dont see how they can keep going up no i dont and they say that its going to come you know a lot of companies are moving out of California because they cant afford people cant afford to live there to work there so theyre moving i know Silicon Valley they say is just well im in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isnt anymore land left to build on most of the oh are you surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it cant be developed so theres very little property that hasnt already been built on oh okay umhum oh okay and one of the problems our city is having is that uh with all of the environmental requirements and the antidevelopment people taking over the city council weve driven out some corporations which were paying a lot of our taxes oh okay and so now theyre going to have to assess us because they weve driven out the businesses that were paying the freight laughter yeah now thats a shame laughter yeah for instance we have the Stamford Shopping Center which was uh paying oh i think it was about a quarter of our uh city budget because of the sales taxes that were collected there and in this recession a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their sales taxes have dropped and were about a million dollars below budget primarily because of the sales tax drop off and that uh and also Hewlett Packard was uh headquartered headquartered here and so everything that they sold the sales taxes uh were paid oh okay ,taxes,2916
hi what do you do with your credit cards oh laughter well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we dont handle them very well we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more laughter laughteroh jeez they theyre theyre really bad for us um matter of fact weve gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa then and we pretty much keep those maxed out oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores yeah we had credit i had probably twenty credit cards umhum umhum um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um two Visas two MasterCards laughter oh gee laughter i mean i had any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble oh sure because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you umhum umhum um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you but each of these had an annual fee also right exactly and the American Express was probably the worst the worst um because the with the Gold card i cant remember how much it was because i didnt even have it very long before i gave it up but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year yeah im forty five right i laughter i which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month exactly you know i thats it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free and um then then i also limited it to one of each one MasterCard and one one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually i then got a Discover card since they pay you back umhum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing it really wasnt my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service umhum umhum um because my husband and i just dont handle credit very well umhum yeah and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out oh i see so im still paying on all these accounts but laughter my accounts are closed so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once were paid off i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and thats it yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards every month only once in my life have i not paid i think thats a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash right and umhum umhum um its a lot easier to keep it in check well and also in a sense theyre giving you a loan for a month so that you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i dont do but but yeah the the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what i buy i just i cant accept yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is i think that um its going to get even worse im im glad that were starting to pay our debts off off now you know we started we started i mean we started this last year umhum umhum and we probably still have about another year to go before were completely out of the hole but i think this they way the whole economys is going right now its just not good to be in debt thats right thats right yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people i guess because i never laughterexperienced it and its not because you know im rich or anything its just uh a mental concept that i have yeah that i just well when when its you when youre getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good laughterat it uhhuh uhhuh and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually itd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face right right but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and youre coming out of it all right i yeah i have ive learned a lot from it um ive learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand laughter umhum umhum and my husbands too because hes hes the same way i am i dont i dont think that well when we when we buy on credit we just dont have a concept of how much money were spending until the bill comes in and all then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much laughter umhum but now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um transmission fell out on our car laughter uh yeah and that paid for a new transmission um and and things like that um and we try we try not to use them for you know incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that umhum umhum clothing laughtersales sales i find are a pain laughter ive ive gotten ive gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i i pay by check a lot more now well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like youre youve really got it under control i i admire you for for having that um uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i i would thats ideally the where where i would like to be umhum umhum yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldnt because my sons tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite at that point but um yeah i didnt like it at all i was very uncomfortable laughter so you know and and i mean it was i can imagine i thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and im going jeez thats outrageous laughter but in in you know retrospect it wasnt all that much i mean a lot of people pay a lot more and oh yeah and you know but still i mean i figured i didnt need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars exactly laughter groceries for a week laughter yeah yeah yeah i i think about all all the money that that weve spent on interest on all of our credit cards and its just incredible but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax weve never been able to take it off our income tax im im fairly newly married ive only been married um less than two years and before that i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions right right so really it was always just money thrown away yeah jeez thrown away and i never really thought about it because you were good at it laughter yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and you know just dont talk about it most most people dont like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think umhum umhum umhum you know because i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal very personal yeah and especially if you if you dont feel youre handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be but i i think the the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt um because thats you have you have to have a roof over your head and i would much rather own my own home than than be renting it like were doing i mean were basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away were renting a house but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is theres nobody in the world thats going to give us a mortgage on a house right right but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year youll be in very good shape yeah its its going to its going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years well be in our own home but um im not really counting on it real soon umhum umhum so thats thats been an even harder lesson then if it affected ,credit_card,2917
okay Ray what do you think about taxes too high obviously umhum yeah i agree but my property taxes have been going up repeatedly uh over the last uh well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that theyve increased oh really um and theyre always saying if you know if they dont raise taxes then theyre going to have to lay off on uh the teachers theyre going to have to lay of uh firemen theyre going to have to lay off the police officers but yet they dont talk anything about the administration about cutting back on that end of it they just theyve theyre in the middle of an expose now on the state and the City of Providence uh public works departments uhhuh yeah and theyve had TV cameras going around uh they wait at some of the yards and they follow the trucks as they come out uh at random just to see what they do during the course of the day and theres not much thats going on ill tell you i mean theyre going to gin mills and and spending half a day in there drinking or theyre going to other peoples homes and doing work oh so youve got you have you have a little graft and corruption huh uh i think thats in any city or town i think i dont think theres any that are free from graft and corruption uh if they could eliminate something like that yeah you know the waste you know thats i think uh  i i think thats a big problem uh uh i dont do you think you get some good services for your taxes do you have a good school district do you have i thought we always did i grew up in a town it was its a small town its in Rhode Island actually i live in Rhode Island i work in Massachusetts about uh six seven months ago they had a breakdown of all school systems and how many children actually once they once they get into the school system how many actually graduate and i was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town yeah around fifty percent uh not quite it was up there it was the forty percentile range yeah thats thats pretty much i think nationwide its you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country yeah thats for school districts im not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that but some schools i i dont know see i i live in a small community  and um we dont pay much in taxes i dont uh this sets this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services we have uh probably whats considered the third worst maybe the fourth worst school district in uh in the in the state other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my for my my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return but my employment tax you know the federal i dont think i get a good federal return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isnt probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer um but i didnt think that was too bad yeah  mine are right now theyre two thousand dollars just a little over two thousand do you own a lot of property just a or a small lot no uh a third of an acre and uh its a colonial house that we have its a saltbox its uh twelve years old the uh  plus the plus the personal property tax we get taxed on our automobiles oh do you see we dont do that and then the the town also has a fire tax so we get a fire tax added to the uh everything on top of that  and its the bulk of its going for the school system yeah see i i but we had uh  when i when i got out of school i i went up and i worked in a in a missile plant up in uh Buffalo and up there they had like all our fire departments were volunteers they had uh the best of equipment and and the best of training a and it didnt really you mean you have a fulltime fire department no fulltime is that what you have now though in your town yes yes weve got all fulltime fire departments how many about how my goodness see thats see thats down here um  being a member of we have we have a couple fulltime firemen but basically you know they well train the guys and they run the show and they live in the firehouse and you know and then most everybody else is volunteer oh okay and then you have call so theres like a core of like each station has like two or four fulltime then everybody else is a volunteer yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here and now theyre all paid which is you know i dont know we can theres a lot of things that can be done uh the federal taxes are out of sight because of yeah oh that just federal taxes just more and more and more and less and less services you know thats it they just keep they dont cut anything and it just feeds on itself and i dont think theres anything that anyone can do anymore its just grown to such proportions yeah such its just out of hand i agree you know the the whole idea like around here um  you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting oh yeah but because of Desert Storm now they said well we cant cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed but you know if we dont cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we dont need such a large army and we dont need if the military comes out and says we dont need all these planes then why does Congress say tough take them anyway you know well its like the  the tanks now everyones after the tanks theyre the you know like the the Mach One is it the Mach One Abrams um i dont know how much it costs lets lets round figure just say a million dollars  now for a million dollars you can produce probably a thousand handheld antitank weapons and you give them to a thousand peasants you dont even have to train them and out of one of those thousands one of them is going to hit now you take out a million dollar tank with a with a you know with a one thousand dollar antitank weapon right but theyre but theyre still going with the with the mechanized vocalizednoise its like the its like the old days when they had the cavalry they didnt want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps or whatever they were doing then and you know a million dollars do you know how many people that would feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls and get and keep in school and you know if we vocalizednoise uh i just in some ways i just dont you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didnt spend the money and they didnt then theyre overruns and if it didnt cost a hundred dollars for a hammer uh you would put a lot of people out of work but those people you put out of work you could you could rechannel their energies into making a rapid transit system in this country thats right oh i agree with you a hundred percent you know our direction has really you know solar energy uh you know theres been some recent great discoveries in solar energy surprisingly because theres theres no money invested in it thats right no um in fact in fact TI just announced uh some breakthroughs in solar energy yeah a big thing you know some flex a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to its being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and they just keep the taxes keep going uh they just keep yeah it that just just for those just for those groups and weve got like the the uh Groton Connecticut where they make the subs and weve got a division in uh in uh Quansett that does it that does the same thing so when they announced the contract up here for that latest uh sub i guess uh Newport News said they were going to sue the government because of you know blah blah this and blah blah that whatever it was but its generating jobs up here for us but its really its really not if you look at the whole you know its generating jobs for a few people if they channeled their energies if they go back to like when Roosevelt put put in the C C C camps and they built border ways for the reservoirs and you know highways and bridges and yeah um and highways see thats a big problem we have um im originally from Pennsylvania and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every bridge oh okay that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh is that right and there are yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didnt affect Boston it went the uh a highway from New Jersey west was it was it funded by by special bonds or im not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country ,taxes,2920
okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job umhum umhum we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you so do you you say you work for a temporary but do you work full time hours doing that um i could if i wanted to id im not right now umhum they but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or um i have been yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if youre not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year then you dont get the benefit then they uh adjust it accordingly yeah yeah you dont get anything at all laughter my uh husband works for a a large oil company and they uh and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so weve always uh always had access to to good benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and life insurance and that kind of thing you know and right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldnt be able to do the temporary work yeah exactly i think medical is probably one of the most important things i know uh here sometime back you know they had had had given him a printout you know of uh to have money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much hed paid and um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well im not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess its there knowing that it could be used if you yeah those must be pretty good benefits ive heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his companys a little bit better so chose yeah i uh weve always been dealt fairly with that way and i would certainly you know caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and how theyre going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage if you knew that uh long term the you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know right yeah whatever you know the differences in the you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husbands work is do you is that the kind of medical you have uh no fortunately we still have the its just regular travelers insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere i guess thats good i dont know uh i cant decide well we uh we have five children so its been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part oh yeah were in a different one now than we used to be and its required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you dont see them as elective then uh you know uh you know you may not get the coverage thats you might have yeah my husband works  for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before theyre really ready because their insurance wont let them stay any longer it frustrates him because theyll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then theyre gone thats right thats right and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people arent willing to go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is what what was paid is almost wasted yeah really and uh well i mean i guess you cant ever totally say that but you know the best good was not gleaned from the laughtermoney laughterspent where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess right yeah yeah do you uh does your husbands company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits well yes i guess so you know uh but not uh not really you know therere there are some options in in every area whether its medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings kind of plan thats subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so yeah thats one thing i wish that we had was like a K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals umhum yeah yeah yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh uh that thats what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so you know its good that that or retire i dont think we can plan on social security taking care of us so no i dont think so i think therere going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for hopefully we wont have such a attitude in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to lend a hand by the time we get there laughtertoo yeah with what they say about how the populations changing i think attitudesll have to change to go along with that exactly so its going to were going to see a lot of changes in the next while and thatll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and i would think so dont you think yeah theyll need more health care i know uh my motherinlaw has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and shes seventy two and uh its just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything but uh does that just supplement like Medicare Medicare or yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh like that so you know i would say that overall weve been very luck and are very happy you know if if i had to yeah thats good see i my husband been selfemployed and hes worked for uh like a small companies and now hes in a little bit bigger company so weve seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have you know yeah yeah i i work for parttime for a man whos selfemployed and gosh you know he and his family he doesnt do anything for me you know because i have what i need through my husband but uh it sure is rough for him its providing for his family yeah when we when he was self selfemployed and we had to get our own insurance to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you could you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something oh i know it but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing happen to you know you or your baby where youd need need somebody to jump in and take over those payments yeah yeah its scary laughter yeah it sure is well i appreciate getting to visit with you well it was good talking to you take care bye now you too bye ,job_benefits,2933
well ive had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but oh really uh i ive been thinking about the fact that the uh GrammRudman Act that was eventually originally passed uh to satisfy to satisfy satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a set of handcuffs on Congress just doesnt work because now we do things outside the GrammRudman with consent of Congress i guess and that doesnt seem to help us to much uh i mean the savings and loan was a great example of that thats outside the Gulf War was outside so it doesnt it i guess we just dont have the resolve to to really face up and and and follow those instructions if if indeed they are politically viable yeah i believe uh i believe thats right uh i guess uh uh you know really what weve got to do is is face up to the fact that uh our economy just will not support uh all of the programs that you know that the the the some of the people and i think its you know the minority numbers not in minorities uh you know im not talking racial stuff but minorities minorities in numbers  uh uh want to have passed uh special interest groups uh have you know their own agenda and i think that its time that uh Congress faces up to what i think the the people in general have faced up to is that we just cannot really support all of those things uh it seems to me that that theres theres a couple of ways that that ive listened to uh various Congress people and the President and the opposition and other people propose and and one thing thats starting to ring a little true to me is um rather severe cuts in in the defense programs since like closing bases and closing down programs etcetera simply because i i just dont believe as much as they want me to believe some of the special interests that you talk about that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer right i i believe thats true i mean were seeing this thing just crumble if if anything now i see the President wants another billion two and a half billion to loan them money because hes afraid of the outright uh chaos and confusion and anarchy because theres no food over there well i yeah you know one of the things that i look at uh uh im in the Dallas area and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the the uh bill thats that called for the closing of military bases and one of the bases thats being closed or thats on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by and when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed there was really a a huge cry you know from the Dallas Fort Worth area about you know how its you know that one is the one that should not be closed you know its its not fair you know laughterto to Dallas Fort Worth but uh you know when Amorys laughter exactly bill passed everybody said hey thats a great thing you know were going to cut back on some of this unnecessary spending just dont gore my ox right right and uh you know i think thats the the same case that that you know would hold true for a number of other programs uh we all talk about uh about how the the uh transfer payments you know are not handled correctly uh you know the the welfare programs and some and some of those things and you know they all need major overhauls yes thats right they all need major overhauls until theyre the ones you know until its the one that that i sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from or you know the laughterone that that my children or my grandchildren or my mother or grandmother you know that weve all we all all got a special interest group that uh you know thats benefiting from some of these uh oh i guess wed almost have to i mean i dont know it just seems to me wed almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didnt have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but i was wondering about you know i i was a little bit encouraged although it didnt seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when they last Fall when they they they did levy a tax on some of the people richer people i mean they increased that bubble tax there i i was a little encouraged by that because thats another way to cure the deficit is by higher taxes nobody wants to pay higher taxes but i mean theres going to be a crisis one of these days thats going to force us to do it anyway right i i i vocalizednoise agree with that i im an accountant a CPA and i went to a seminar some seminars today and uh one of our opening speaker our keynote speaker this morning yeah yeah  yes yes was is the president of one of the major Texas companies or fairly major anyway and one of his comments had to do with the state taxes  the state state tax the state Texas is uh you know is in a little bit of a bind tax wise and one of the proposal is uh to uh have a new state income tax but to have it only on on corporations yeah yeah and of course you know hes corporate president corporate uh CEO and uh that was just not the right thing you know laughter the the corporations are paying too much tax already so its you know well they pass it on to us laughteranyway laughteri ive never ive never even thought that they that they would absorb laughterthat laughterright so the same you know right the same you know same thing applies you know if the tax is is geared to you know or or aimed toward me then its a bad tax if its aimed toward you its a good tax laughter yeah laughter thats right of course it that that vocalizednoise thats again that that issue just like you sited Amorys bill on the bases but i i dont know i vocalizednoise it just seems to me that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i i think im correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget is is is allocated now for debt payments right yeah i believe at least that much or interest payment on the debt but uh yeah and and and i know if i had to pay that much in my out of my salary i mean it it its it it just seems to me i dont know whether it it thats kind of a colloquium just use common sense but it it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point when the Medicare programs cant pay off when the when when they cant pay off the the the savings and loans uh uh situation when the banks cant be insured any longer when the pensions cant be insured then people are really are going to demand something to be done but it appears to me that i dont know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place you know i i think that uh you know i think were just going to have to laughter as as Gerald Ford said were going to have to bite the bullet and uh uh and yeah but how do you get people to do that though i mean i i i i i dont even find myself you know i see i i play that game with myself sometimes i know things are a little tough so i say well ill just charge this on the credit card and ill pay it off in a little bit and then then every once in a while i get a shock i get the credit card up to six seven thousand i say this is absolutely insane and we sort of tighten up or something comes by to pay the damn thing off but right yeah i i i i i think that were not paying anything off i mean obviously were not paying anything off we weve gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in the last ten years and yeah vocalizednoise and i i guess thats the the problem or you know vocalizednoise as i see it anyway that we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as individuals would do and thats you know we cut off our spending and cut off our charging when our when our credit gets out of hand you know laughter yeah thats right yeah i saw some Japanese guy on television today he was talking about the the the trade deficit he said as long its so its so simple that that it was it was kind of it was kind of humorous he said as long as you continue to spend more than you continue to uh sell as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell youll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that thats your problem well i mean i i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but i guess it is the truth we just keep laughterbuying laughterthis laughterstuff and we dont have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas and it is a very complex situation but uh i i guess but as a as an accountant do you do you find people are worried when you talk to them about what our government might do or  yeah i think uh i think vocalizednoise not so much about what the government might do but that you know theyre worried about what theyre not you know what they cant seem to do uh its you know its its everybody seems to agree vocalizednoise what they cant seem yes that that thats right that were really in you know in dire financial situation that something has to be done and the concern is that nothing is being done you know yeah i was i guess i was a little comforted by the fact that on this Gulf War uh that we have received uh at least sixty percent of the money laughter that we asked for and i i should imagine i dont know how thats coming you know i remember some i i just dont i havent seen a real accounting of that yeah i have not uh have not seen that so i guess i guess uh uh if i was to take a position now and sum up because i dont want to talk too long is that the short term i guess we have to some how as you say address those issues in the long term wed either have to wed have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big the transfer payments and the military an and just bite that bullet right i and im i believe thats right okay okay laughterokay laughternice laughtertalking to you uhhuh bye okay im going to cut it off and uh because ive got to laughtergo nice talking to you Bob byebye ,budget,2936
okay um do you want to start do you have a well credit cards um i think think they are wonderful but um i think you have to have a lot of restraint um i have never been in trouble with credit cards but uh my youngest daughter is and a friend of mine is and i think it is terrible that they can uh you know wipe out a max in uh such a short time uh i never pay interest charges i value my money too much to uh line somebody elses pockets with my money and i always um pay it off before um i am charged any interest on my balance so you never let it run up on you that is wonderful that is wonderful im uh i i kind of uh uh im just do very you know just just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off and then i start wanting something and i dont really have enough well dont have enough in savings savings you know like for a big purchase then uh sometimes i i uh lose sight of it you know its it just it is just is easy to use and then uh after a while i i am like you i hate paying those people interest and then i make um umhum i make i i added like uh uh wrote uh an addition to to my car loan through the credit union which i knew was lower interest just to pay them all off and then i swore i would never use them again right you really have to show a lot of restraint but if you look at  if you look at the time frame on that uh you will find that you have about six or seven weeks before you have to make that payment back to the credit card company without being charged any interest the only thing is you have to make sure that you dont charge more than you know you are going to be able to pay thats correct yeah you at a given time and your budget has to be so that you can uh you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that yeah and the problem the problem is especially with young people is they they want things now they dont want to have to wait for them and credit cards are the way to do that thats right and then then theyre in trouble well thats what the you know thats what thats what it is geared for advertisement you know is uh to wet you appetite and give you that oh ive got to have that i cant live without that and thats the image that the younger generation has you know i have a i have a friend who uh well she is old enough to know better but uh she she did it and she got really in bad shape she ended up going into bankruptcy and Palley Royal is her downfall and there is no limit on those things on that they just let you come and spend and you know run it up run it up so i dont know who was that that could Palley Palley Royal is that a department store oh okay thats probably i i do not know if i dont know if it is local no it is not in uh in Dallas huhuh no we we have Dillards and uh Sanger Harris and Macys and no Palley Royal Neiman Marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem laughtereither i know i know a lot of people who uh some gals some ladies at work who dont have any problems with money or anything but they they really love Palley Royal so you know they it is just hard you know you got stay laughteraway or else you might end up you just cant help yourself and buy selfcontrol yeah selfcontrol though is the key selfcontrol is the key my daughter has my daughter is twenty and she got a Sears credit card when she was about eighteen umhum umhum and uh Christmas before last she and her boyfriend her boyfriend had gotten one too i believe and they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to everyone in their family i mean they spent lots of money on they gave each other these beautiful things they gave stuff to all of us and we were going oh dear i cant believe you all did this you should not have done this and they got angry and said we wanted to do it umhum umhum okay now she is still paying on that Sears charge she has now you know shes learned and she she is uh definitely paying it off paying paying on it and not running it back up but you cant tell them well experience is the best teacher and sometimes you know uh a lot of us have have to learn by experience and and uh if you can learn by someones elses past mistakes then you are very wise thats right if you can heed to advice given the only good thing one good thing about credit cards though uh especially in business if you uh you have to you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company thats true yes i am yeah umhum and then uh in fact i know of a man who is in uh he is in a he he he he well he he is in an oil pipe pipe line selling kind of a thing and he has to he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission you know later on but if he did not have credit cards he could not exist because a lot of those you know because he knows six weeks down the road he is probably you know he is going to get the money to pay for it but he really does so sometimes i think oh credit cards are you know really a blessing uh but you have to be wise when you use them thats true and uh i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and you know theyre just hurting theirselves and when you uh have a bankruptcy uh it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record oh yeah and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people wont touch you and youve got to live that down umhum that is true thats really true so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but dont abuse it right uh you know like emergencies or something that you do not have the ready cash that you do not have cash and you have to oh absolutely sure your car breaks down or you have to you have to have something its a real its you know you do not have the money in savings so it really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it but but like you say use it wisely thats right only in you know when you really have to or knowing that you are going to pay it off every every month so that is that is something about American Express if you only use American laughterExpress you do not have a choice well there is a lot of people that uh know exactly what they are doing and they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that theyve bought and put it like in hiding youre kidding no ive heard uh uh there was a radio program in Dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact its nationwide and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that uh program about these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things and then they went bankrupt and they were knowing they were going to go into bankruptcy and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just umhum so they it was planned and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed and i dont know who um determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely what they are were indebted for oh no right so it it they use it as a scam instead of uh to me they were criminals and they used that that in a in a really bad situation and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are working on that to cover you know cover all the loopholes that might exist but ive never been in that situation and hope i never have to be yeah me too really well i guess we covered it do you have any do you have anything else you want to add no i cant think of anything i am sure that we havent covered everything because that is uh that is a great big uh a ball well if you have got any other thoughts uh credit throw them out i cant think of anything right now laughter well listen thank you for calling and you have a good day well thank you Catherine bye ,credit_card,2951
okay now you can tell me what you do uh well i work with computers just like your laughterson and i actually do research in speech recognition oh great and so as part of the reason im participating in the project is to to see how the stuff goes but um i was working well actually i havent worked for any large companies per se uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but yeah laughter well the one John works for seems to have a lot you know good benefits and the pay is decent  yeah the uh well actually where  i was working with the company  one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive because were were paying our own insurance right now umhum umhum umhum for it um and im we actually had a little baby so im taking a little bit of laughter time off from work ah congratulations great i had i had a granddaughter laughter and um so one thing that im very concerned with now is first of all health benefits because its more important with a family and you know our doctors visits routine doctors visits covered my health insurance only covers um  your emergency care and so umhum do you have major medical benefits right yeah but i dont that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is right well my our deductible is five hundred but its for each each person yeah thats pretty hard thats pretty high event yeah right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesnt cover if you get sick it doesnt cover right thats thats right thats  doctors visits things like that and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too oh yeah it certainly is yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not not very good laughter but its a its a type of area we live in of course living expenses arent as bad either though which makes a difference and probably the medical care medical care is less expensive too well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but uh so i think that in general the doctors fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower uh well from what ive seen from my aunt and uncle uh really from Florida up to here theyre not that much different well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan is that right and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston oh thats a big difference and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but thats a huge difference just between uhhuh uhhuh you know and its two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable oh yeah should be so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that im really concerned about and most companies dont have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have yes uhhuh  vocalizednoise you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and id go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is and itd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too umhum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know and i it would be more convenient more productive i think and uh it its its i dont know how they do it i laughterreally laughterdont you know getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and  all the preparations and your and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that umhum umhum and that to me well that you know the those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with life insurance and uh retirement plans but laughter i dont know i think those benefits you mentioned mentioned sometimes theyre even more important than you the wage itself if you can get those benefits even uh they they come out to much a much better laughterbenefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times right because youre you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that its worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that  umhum umhum oh yeah oh yeah it make it a lot better you know everything else being equal because your life would be so much easier and theres a question of quality of life also vocalizednoise uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on whats going on probably you know with your child right and you you you dont feel like youre a half hour away if she something happened right yeah and youre less preoccupied with it i think right yeah so but unfortunately there arent i think IBM has started having that in certain locations i dont know my daughter one daughter works for MCI and they dont they where she works they dont have anything like that uhhuh is that locally uh Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Pennsylvania yeah because Pittsburghs a big enough city too but you know i wouldnt be surprised if things like that didnt happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones vocalizednoise umhum  umhum just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies vocalizednoise uhhuh like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week and um you know call call my own days call my own hours and oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great yeah yeah and and you know which many times at a large company its almost impossible umhum umhum to do things like that they say youre going to do it this way and thats the way its going to be yeah right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and youre not allowed two weeks and one day yeah yeah yeah and so it all depends on what your position is there too true well thats true in any any company i think  yeah uh ive ive never well i cant say ive never ive maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the home you know out of the home but uh the rest of the time ive been an laughterAvon lady and a vocalizednoise lady laughter was that when you were um well you know those have its pluses and minuses too ive been a consultant recently and so i dont have any benefits at all and umhum and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself yeah right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and um they they they usually consultants make very good income right and they they refuse to give him more salary is that right because they say they cant pay more than this and that and theyre not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so its new its harder to get uh oh the uh your increases and things but um a consultant consultant consultant really is vocalizednoise should be more knowledgeable than everybody else laughter you know so it stands to reason they should really have have more benefits yeah well the right well vocalizednoise hes been doing a long term hes being called a consultant and hes really sort of a temporary employee at a place uhhuh uhhuh and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesnt get any health benefits he doesnt get well we dont care about retirement benefits he doesnt get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody elses salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know its a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff yeah and theyll do it ,job_benefits,2982
do you use your credit cards very often um no not really we use gas cards more than anything okay is that just out of habit or convenience basically convenience uh which led to habit i guess okay i dont use uh gasoline credit cards i used to have one but i didnt use it uh i used it so seldom that id get letters from Mobil uh reminding me that i had a credit card to use laughter oh really yeah we dont we dont ever we dont carry a whole lot of cash with us so we use the the gas cards because our families are both out of town and like when we travel and stuff we use the gas cards right so you basically use them as an alternative to carrying cash yeah yeah and then we have a an American Express thats through TI that Steve uses just for TI stuff are you uh solicited a lot uh for other uh credit cards yes a lot what uh criteria do you consider on whether or not youll accept a particular card uh probably the uh uh if theres a premium each year and the uh the APR yeah i wont get a card if theres an annual fee and theres its its kind of hard to beat TI and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it and most most of the time it goes unopened yeah i i i think that Texans is charging thirteen point nine percent uh interest yeah if if that much theyre thirteen something but im not sure if its i think its a flat thirteen right now it could be could be i dont uh use them often enough to even keep tabs on it but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year i think thats and then youre then youre if youre that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year laughter right right and i look for a grace period too so that they dont charge interest on from from the day of purchase and of course no annual fee yeah that would that would help a lot i im not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee im not really well i i think it just generates revenue for the companies that uh for the banks that sponsor the credit cards well i guess so because its not any more prestigious to have to pay it uh as far as getting another card where you dont i mean you know uh i get uh applications for cards from oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card oh really and uh the incentive there was that theyd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card right and get a discount on it right yeah that i did did the same thing with uh Foleys they uh uh had a fifteen percent discount on a purchase if you just apply for a card right i did that with my husband uh he was off working at TI in Austin one day and so i went out to the mall to kind of look around hit Mervyns and found some stuff stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think thats the only card i have thats yeah uhhuh you know recently is gotten a Mervyns card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have ive had it for months yeah i always maintain a zero balance uh i dont like owing anybody anything laughter yeah yeah i dont i dont like it a whole lot either if you want to borrow money therere better ways to do it uh i think you can get a loan through the credit union for about uh oh i dont know nine or ten percent now i guess yeah yeah and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh not a very good way to uh to make to make use of borrowing money yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i cant charge it its at its limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit it just it just i guess its that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know yeah its the buy now pay later plan and uh live for today yeah and i just its that yeah it just borrow worry about it tomorrow laughter nobody bothers saving any money yeah and it just i dont i dont really go for them and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them up just for the fact that TI had lower rates you know and decided and i mean when i tried to close with Chase Manhattan it was just like pulling teeth oh yeah i mean i couldnt close theyd send me a statement every little this is your new you know balance with bonus points or whatever you know and its like look i closed this months ago and i dont want any more of your letters i dont want anything and well you have a credit balance well send me a check laughter you know yeah well theres a a basic problem too with not using credit cards that they are good credit references when i closed on my house mortgage uh the mortgage company was looking for uh references credit references and i didnt have any credit cards charged up at all i keep the balance paid off so they make lousy credit reference then yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well just list your major ones and and the balance still owed on it you know or give it a balance still owed on it and thats all we did when the balance is zero it laughterdoesnt help much laughter i get a lot of uh pre approved applications from various organizations and i throw all those out yeah and its like well who are you to approve laughter something for me without my permission anyway but i think um i think what you can do as far as i dont think as many companies when you are a good customer i dont think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers right uhhuh because a lot of times you have to write and ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever yeah uhhuh that usually doesnt happen unless ive heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someones so quick to turn you over because youre thirty days late i think they should they should do do that more often yeah i think youre right what do you think about that uh Discover card vocalizednoise i well uh laughter funny thing about the Discover card is i just pulled a uh one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired uh last month i didnt cash it uh they they sent me a dollar uh refund from last years purchase i i used it one time oh really and uh i got a dollar credit a dollar check but i didnt uh cash the check and the check expired but on my last statement i noticed that they credited my account with a dollar credit the dollar you didnt cash could very well be oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because its like you know well pay you for and im going wait a minute you know ive got so many uh well i dont have a lot of cards but ive got a lot that i never used uh i stick basically with uh the Texans MasterCard and uh very seldom use the American Express card yeah we dont we wouldnt even have one if it wasnt for TI and Steve traveling we just sure corporate card you know i would never pay thirty five dollars or more a year for uh use of a card and uh we basically just have the we you know we cut up a lot of cards when we you know like its just as easy just to use two you know instead of paying so much ,credit_card,2987
hi do do you have lots of credit laughtercards laughter yeah we well we have quite a few but we dont really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when were traveling and stuff wherever theres a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa we dont use those too often what about you um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them but i think ive even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasnt using them too much and i dont drive that much but i have you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen laughtermillion cards but as long as like my MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i dont know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here dont let you do it too much oh really and so i dont but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but its not really a credit card oh is it like an automatic debit or something oh huh its a it its a debit card yeah and um just you know its vocalizednoise many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash baside bye thanks easide um yeah because theyre just so well set up with it laughter yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money set aside already to and then we just pay it off the next month we never pay we dont like to pay interest on the laughtercredit cards at all right well yeah i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i laughteroccasionally do and you know ill forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didnt get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit uh finance charge on it which pissed me off because um you know i really did mail it in time right yeah they have no proof of that i dont i dont want to ill probably talk to them some more discuss it but i i never um usually never laughterpay finance charges laughter yeah that yeah we we screwed up one laughtertime laughterlike that too we mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check i had that hassle one time and i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it so you know i guess i dont know who the the burden of proof is on yeah i dont either you know its kind of a because you never do when i pay bills i dont make a Xerox copy of it or i dont no you figure youll get your check back if you have to right or i dont get a i dont mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank to have a proof of when i mailed it and i mean you cant do that itd be ridiculous laughter really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i dont do real often or something from out of state you know where if somethings wrong you dont want to end up having to pay for it a couple times ive had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didnt really get this or well you can i dont know what this is right or i returned it so dont charge it yeah well thats basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um didnt wasnt didnt do what these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldnt do that so he brought it back to them and theyre supposed to modify it and so i called the credit card company and said well we havent really taken possession because its not useful for us we cant use it and then they said well then dont pay it and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soon as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now theyre hitting vocalizednoise laughter with a finance charge oh laughter but its sort of you know its its half our fault yeah since it well yeah if you filed that letter with them then theyll kind of and so we right if id filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay so i learned that for the next time im like you too about the yearly fees i dont uh i dont like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we dont have to pay a yearly fee on and since we dont pay the interest it doesnt really matter what the interest rate right yeah is to us as long as we dont have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety laughterdollars or something i think i cant remember but we decided let that one go and well my husband and i both have that and i dont know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think its like seventy five dollars for me and im not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like vocalizednoise nowadays im not sure so sure that its worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express and then they dont have the credit limit because ive over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and youre over the limit on the credit card and um with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell you that but then that was one advantage but thats thats like i dont i think its seventy five dollars for me and forty for him for a year which is a lot be vocalizednoise but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one thats free because there are some like i think ATT has one thats free if you make two purchases a year its more worth it well so laughter yeah that wouldnt be too hard to do laughter yeah and so thats easy enough to do and if thats true thats um it it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that weve never had that problem either i and i dont understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i dont understand yeah because people think it doesnt really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process and sometimes it comes in right away and its like oh well i laughterguess i have to pay that too because yesterday like many times ill try ill buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i wont get that bill until the next bill not this bill and itll come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway yeah laughter but sometimes the vocalizednoise is long like ive had things that i didnt get billed on for two or three months yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have those i guess theyre called those pointed sale terminals where its like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah immediately yeah but thats what happened with us like we bought a washing laughtermachine laughterseven months ago and then i got billed like the next laughterday oh laughtergosh it didnt matter because we couldnt have paid for it by check but we prefer vocalizednoise like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that yeah thats nice you can uh return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October and you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year weve got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturers guarantee and somethings like that are yeah i like that feature and the insurance like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something thats breakable or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so thats you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage but things like if your baggage gets lost you get money for that oh really to buy new bags and things like that oh i didnt know that and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so ,credit_card,2999
 okay are you a TIer is somebody in your family a TIer no uh my fiancee works for the computers for the government and thats how he got it oh okay so who do you work for i just graduated from college so you dont have any benefits at all to talk about youre just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits laughter or what im looking for oh okay okay well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers no huhuh didnt get that far you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get oh well well ill tell you a little bit about what TI has as benefits we do have uh like most companies we have medical insurance although theyre tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um set hospitals in the area they call it network hospitals theyre hospitals oh yeah ive heard of that yeah theyre hospitals that theyre uh agreeing with uh TI that theyll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep costs you know costs down now theyre going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors so its almost like a um uh an HMO you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isnt in the network then it will be less benefits that you get we have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like ive had a couple of crowns recently and if you didnt have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i pay yeah it can yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month because it always seems like if youre going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more um we do have pension although ive realized recently that the pension doesnt seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working youre not thinking about that oh i like to think about laughterthat after youve been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all thats in there i dont thinks its going to pay too long when i get out um we do have a new thing that theyve started a few years ago um its not an i R A its called a four oh one K plan its kind of like pension you put in so much money and then TI um meets you half way up to a certain maximum so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents so that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan course you can buy stock in the company but you know thats not always a real for sure kind of thing course not always safe laughter yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down i dont know if its any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like you know last year it was forty dollars a share and now this year its thirty six dollars a share and you go gee im losing money laughter doesnt quite feel as good umhum yeah and we get you know vacation normally after youre here for six months and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you and its one nice thing about TI is after youve been here uh for five years you get three weeks umhum oh thats nice a lot of places make you work like ten years or so before you get that much yeah uhhuh and we get some we get uh decent holidays um we at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend and at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas they float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on so thats nice so you always get two days at Christmas a lot of people just take you know that week i normally take that week somehow you know you only have to take three days of vacation and you get the whole week at Christmas time yeah well um i can just tell you like you know from my dad and my fiancee like my dad well theres twelve kids in my family whoa okay so uh the the dental was very important you know to my dad but um i think they took the dental away now he worked for United Telephone System its you know its just another you know telephone network and they took the dental away but now i think theyre going to start getting into eye oh yeah yeah i think uh um i dont use the services but yeah i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage you get discounts on uh glasses and im not quite sure theres certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that yeah and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock but my fiancee hes on that same kind of pension as what you said only for everything he puts in theyll match it up to a certain amount like if he puts in a dollar theyll put in a dollar you know and then hes only allowed i think i dont know if its maybe five percent or something like that that hes allowed to put in and theyll match it so and um he works for the did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards okay well he works for them they changed their name now but thats thats where he works and um he his vacation is really nice hes going to be there three years at the end of this month and hell be getting three weeks vacation gee thats pretty decent yeah yeah okay you know of course its its for the government and he has all the holidays off right and you get some extra ones federal workers always seem to get you know you get Columbus Day and Veterans Day and those ones that you couldnt really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow yeah uhhuh he has it really nice its nice where he works and um he seems to be very happy you know like his hospitalization and you know he has all that and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any oh yeah okay but you have to go you know to certain ones but still that works out really nice you know yeah were doing an HMO right now um and when we go to get prescriptions its five dollars so but so you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes vocalizednoise which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better um you thats like a buck a capsule thats not bad either so if youve got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five its a pretty good savings then theres other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldnt cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow so it isnt a percentage but sometimes you work you know you manage to make ,job_benefits,3001
 here we go Jay all right uh can you give me your ideas on uh what you think about the budget well on the budget im not for sure i wouldnt um start off first of all by putting a limit on the members of congress and then maybe we could get some new people in there to work on it but other than the budget i think they just have to uh i dont know i think they have to just have uh maybe um uh almost a like a constitutional convention and get sharp people from all over the country to come together try to decide what were going to cut i think we cut the wrong areas and and just maybe start all over again almost like family sometimes i have to do this call time out and then yeah vocalizednoise i guess some of the states had had started started out like uh  California i think i think they had is it proposition two and a half they had out there and Massachusetts had the same type of of uh legislation you know they only can raise taxes so much there theres a cap on it see down here in Texas they just they dont state they we dont have a state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the fees they just call them fees and theres a fee for everything you dont have a state income tax we dont have a state income tax and uh theres no uh the sales tax isnt on food is that right or anything like that so we yeah our sales tax isnt either uh its a yeah so were not taxed very much uh but the fees are pretty pretty ridiculous but i think we just may need to have uh you know get sharp people from all over the country into some sort of a like a constitutional convention and then to say whats working in one place why wouldnt it work someplace else i noticed Bridgeport Connecticuts declared bankruptcy laughter yeah isnt that something uh yeah it was just in the paper the last day or two yeah yeah so yeah and it happened i think Michigan way back in the late sixties when Soapie Williams was governor they declared bankruptcy the whole state of Michigan so its yeah its just theyre just running um i i dont know about about Texas but i know up around here as soon as uh like Massachusetts well Rhode Island too it doesnt make any difference which state when things get tight they always threaten theyre going to cut uh police fire uh theyre going to layoff teachers but they vocalizednoise its the rank and file they never talk about cutting at the top you know the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant oh absolutely absolutely absolutely and i think the federal government is the same way that its its just gotten so huge that i dont think anyone has got a handle on it anymore no by leaving  theres no  yeah yeah by leaving that particular group in there to make the decisions its not going change so somebody has to get it to where that its just a rank and file citizens around the country and and the and like a thats right thats true yeah like a huge convention you know if theyd send uh so many people from each uh um they could do them they could do them in the state by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at uh political conventions um yeah but youd what what it would end up it would be the same old people going so thats vocalizednoise probably there should be uh uh a mandatory limit on on how long you can serve like maybe only two terms  yeah thats ive always thought that vocalizednoise and thats if we you know because some of these old boys have been in there for a thousand years get in get in there forever and then that seniority system and then the  some creep in there and uh so um yeah its probably going to have to start there and get some new blood in there and then um maybe they can look at it and they can you know each one of them thats in there now have got their own favorite projects and all you know theyre theyre cronies and  um but i dont think you can do anything i dont think theyre i think the budgets out of hand until you can get in there and change the administration and im talking about right through from top to bottom right i think uh well even at the beginning of the country Alexander Hamilton wanted to put a limit on um the the President was only supposed to serve seven years and they didnt uh they didnt follow through on that but i ive ive thought about a twelve year cap for  congressmen and senators and maybe go back to a seven year term for the President sort of you know  vocalizednoise it so it would run could you hold one second just a second Ray  yeah thats all right my wifes a psychologist and i thought that might be somebody calling in for her oh i see how are things in Massachusetts after Dukakis then um Massachusetts Massachusetts is in is in terrible terrible shape theyre uh uh theyre still talking about uh uh laying laying off a lot of people you know cutting cutting a lot of services um the state is not funding any of the any of the cities and towns so so the cities and towns now are are forced to go out and uh raise capital uh its its uh yeah this is Texas is trying its just a bad situation and its not only there but Rhode Island is the same its just isnt there you know its in the same boat oh thats crazy because Texas uh it looks like its trying to bounce back a little bit but its weve still got a ways to go its uh i teach in a college and i and im in a im in pretty good shape but some of these uh theres just a lot of people out of work lot of homeless and the budget is just i dont weve got a new governor democratic democratic governor female and uh shes trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and thats the problem is that you if you come in too fast you cant get reelected yeah you know um theres an awful lot of people uh in this country that are idle uh when you say like the homeless and theres the prison population is skyrocketing uh i think they should probably go back and borrow some of uh Roosevelts ideas you know uh set up some of these CCC camps like they had way back yes yes but um that you know give people a little uh dignity because i know a lot of these people would like to work they just dont know how uh to go out and get find a job or theyre not skilled or or something and it  it doesnt take a lot of skill to rake leaves or do some of those things like those  thats right they could they could uh they could build roads uh bridges uh uh canals uh theres theres a ton of things they can do we can take in uh they could stop start uh a rapid transit right right uhhuh  movement like when they when they first broke into uh  uh the interstate highways uh we dont have a rapid transit system in this country though worth a worth a damn no we dont we dont  the um we and you mentioned the prison prison population another thing you can do in the budget weve got a lot of people who dont need to be in prison i mean theres some of the lesser crimes anymore probably you dont need to put them away put them in some work program  thats true right  yep you know a minimum very minimum security and this theyve got a job and you you work uh you know work this long some of them may find that they they like it and want to take it permanently then you could just switch them over in another branch of that and pay them um a decent wage you youd whatever youd pay them would be a lot better than having them in jail or having them out on the street thats right because i dont know what what it costs per year per inmate its a its a lot if they just if they just like paid them a wage and let them perform something useful ,budget,3032
well we uh taxes everyone thinks taxes are too high im sure but uh i think we do get quite a value good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases what do you think uh yeah i i think so i i i i think im i think im uh a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh i think im more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i dont know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh laughter at this stage its hard to tell laughter and uh i know im a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so im not im uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that uh for Texas and and well at this stage i think weve taxed property almost to the limit because like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that its precluding people from being able to own a home yeah i think so because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson and its up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house yeah yeah but now were getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it werent for the taxes were putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you yeah yeah yeah now im uh uh you know id wed when we moved to Richardson Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the public public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country uh one of the uh i believe i dont know which one it is uh down there whether its Hobby or uh  the other exgovernor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states yeah i think thats right yeah that would provide uh possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but i pay eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even laughter laughter laughteri i dont i dont know about that i laughter yeah laughter well i quit ten years ago so laughter i i see okay no uh i couldnt afford to start again laughter yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think but all the various taxing taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime yeah and and even if it is isnt going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that its not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know well this this is a thing i think its like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you cant come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it but now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive yeah and the other thing is that when when it when its vocalizednoise the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that whereas in in uh in Dallas here weve weve got uh those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART and uh for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to uh both those centers of of business plus everything else thats scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area you know like New York does yeah yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere and new York and some people dont even own a car and know how to drive a car right right someone made the analogy uh with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street and im just as guilty as anyone else oh yeah yeah i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling yeah right and uh most people are that way because theyre used to not having public transportation so but i here again i think the thing i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something that laughter i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying a little bit much oh yeah yep you know yep yeah we could well thats about all i can say at this time yeah i think i think so i think that will probably do it so okay its been real nice talking with you good enough bye ,taxes,3040
do you use credit cards a good bit i do and i wish i didnt laughter before i got married uh about the only credit cards i used were gas cards because i didnt like carrying you know the cash with me all the time but i just never wanted to get into the hangup of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head in fact i remember getting my first MasterCard and the only reason i got it was you know there was a while years ago when you couldnt cash a check without like a MasterCard or Visa and so thats why i went ahead an got one  it was a mistake laughter yeah well actually i i have a whole wallet full of credit cards i dont use them very often um oh i may use i try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week and try to use a different one so that you know i have keep those active i have a half a dozen department store credit cards and im ill use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that just enough to keep them active my biggies are the Visa MasterCard and Discover and for the most part i had used those for like uh charging airline tickets  where i can pay for those you know you could make make the transaction over the telephone or i fly Southwest a good little bit which means i can just run that card through the machine thats right uh and saves a lot of time and thats what i was using it for however we had a had a a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative you must have the money to do this with and you do not have any other options so i charged all three of those cards up and right now i am paying paying and praying  i know how that goes and thats exactly what weve i mean i have to say i have been thankful for them because there were times when um but uh it was just like that when uh we had to have the money we had no way around it and the only way to do it is go get you know an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it but its one of those im glad it was there well i never did  right i never did use it for an advance most of my charges were uh medications oh i see didnt have cash for the medications or it was uh the doctor would accept MasterCard or Visa  and uh a lot of times you can get you by using those for uh uh different labs will use those charge accounts for do you find now though that even some doctors wont ive gone to some doctors that say you know i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards and so many of them dont anymore well i have not i like i said that was just one period in my life where that was critical i dont generally charge i say well i will need a checkup in six months and i kind of set that aside and just pay for it im reimbursed on insurance anyway and i can handle you know paying for it and waiting two or three weeks yeah right getting into a credit card fiasco is easy oh it is  it is easy and its very difficult to get out i just cringe every month when i see those interest charges i know i say wow i i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off big deal im saving two percent right but you know the interest even though it bothered me it didnt used to bother me so much because of course you could list it on a schedule A and you got all your interest you know uh towards your tax deductions and now theyve messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it and but it but it is easy to get into a credit card problem and i umhum umhum i think about young people that think you know theres kind of that feeling of hey its so neat i have my first credit card and and they just dont understand that you still have to be able to make the payments you know oh yeah and its not just paying back what youve charged its paying that and half again uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars youre going to pay twenty twenty five in interest charges thats right thats right thats right you only get half of that paid for the principal so im looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts now as the monthly payment uh i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments uh as long as i dont have a major disaster where i have to use it again i can i can do that meantime though im not building any reserves anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards no and thats frightening to me thats right thats frightening too uh i i just i my husband is in business for himself i work for TI but he doesnt and uh  were uh i ive kind of got my fingers crossed crossed ive learned when youre in business for yourself that that you you dont count on something until its happened you know but hes got some vocalizednoise you know its those once in a lifetime cases and after ten years hes got two of them and they should pay through next month and and were both just looking at each other every night going man thatll pay off like both of our MasterCards laughteryou laughterknow and you know just in one lump because thats the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money or its like you say you pay forever oh right right umhum umhum umhum umhum and so im really looking forward to that  well you either need a big chunk of money or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account you can make a single lump sum payment now those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments sharp good no problem thats right sure yeah i agree laughterthats laughterright because youre living on the other guys money for a while but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money laughter and it just irks me i say my gosh i had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this and ive got three cards ive lost a whole day of my life  i know and i know youre like what am i working for today laughter to interest yeah yeah and that just blows my mind i my house is paid for my car is paid for ive got some home improvements but even the payment on that doesnt equal the payment on one of those credit cards  its incredible boy i wish i could say that my house and well my car is paid for now it was wrecked three weeks ago but but you see again the credit cards came in handy i had to have the money to pay rental car pay this pay that till the insurance company pays back and uh thats right  i think that is a good healthy safe use of credit cards yeah because you know thats coming back to pay it off umhum umhum uh i went to a seminar they said dont ever use your credit card for consumable items you only use credit cards for investments i say for crying out loud if i had the money to invest you know laughter if i could do some investing youd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card thats laughterright that doesnt make a bit of sense to me i thought God dang where is his pencil thats right well the smart half was dont pay it for consumables dont you know if you cant afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash dont put it on a credit card you know and and so that that is the smart half thats right but uh and i can remember before we had kids we did that a lot but it was no biggie you know because we could pay it off while after kids and youre paying child care and other things all of a sudden its not so easy to pay off so we cut that out real quick laughter umhum umhum and uh but i i do like having them there there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use but you have to have a very good sense of saving and or common sense not not to get yourself in trouble  you also have to have that willingness to commit to that because youre committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it ,credit_card,3064
Americans Americans like me and whether or not uh uh uh not i think that were paying too much taxes um that including taxes in general or income tax and um  the other thing was do we get what we pay for i mean what what is our what is our opinion on that so are you prepared to talk laughter let me push oh i guess so go by ear laughter let me push one here laughter okay um well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas its most interesting because were one of the few if i dont know of any other state um does not have a state income tax and so we dont have a state income tax but we certainly make up for it in other ways here um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent oh wow isnt that awful laughter how about you what do you have there uh we have a six percent sales tax uhhuh and you have state income tax also umhum yeah well its been people here have just have this um theyve been really holding out in the legislature and its starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i dont know if Texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually theyre going to have to do it but um do you think you pay too much there or how do you feel about that i dont mind my taxes as much as my social security oh really interesting uhhuh yeah yeah um the taxes i dont know i can deal with that because i know everyone else is paying in laughtertoo i guess you know yeah yes but uh oh i dont know uh the one thing that we dont have uh tax on clothes do you uhhuh um yes we do have tax on clothes thats what i thought i know New York has also has a sales tax on clothes and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that how interesting i guess i didnt realize that um we dont have tax on groceries for instance um no well we dont have it necessarily on food but then theres other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know right yes yes i should i shouldve um delineated yet your absolutely right its the food the consumable food parts that you know we dont have to pay tax on yeah yeah and you really have to watch your your um your bill sometimes i think um its real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries laughter and thats when it really starts to add on and um so um thats that is sort of a help but um i dont know its just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of of tax on uh any sale as far as im concerned um yeah that would uh its real interesting this last um tax season im a student and the last tax season i had a just a part time job helping out in a tax office and the woman that owned the office was saying shed had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax deduct yeah and uh you know if youre not a home owner its or if you havent sold property or uh have something major like that its hardly you know it its just not much else you can do and she said its really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts cant do oh really and see i take it she was an accountant cant do it any more laughter so yeah uhhuh i know well i i i also was a student i just graduated in May and um i graduated with a finance degree but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax laughter how interesting that was the big joke laughter oh gosh where did you go to school Clarion University uhhuh uhhuh well youre youre the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too im a graduate student having gone back after many years so um nevertheless i am a student and poor laughter so its uh um you know its been i i guess as far as people like uh our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with Americans with um college age students you know and and i there just i dont know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and uhhuh i think they should go back i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy oh yes absolutely yeah because uh it seems like you they still come out okay um you know uh they yeah yeah you know they always have the argument well you know well whos to say we dont work harder to get that you know well i kind of have my doubts laughter i dont care how much they take off of you you know youre still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i ive worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work yes seems that way yeah that the higher they get the you know at least i dont know it seems like um they must feel like theyre paid for all of the years of experience or um vocalizednoise or or something or just the title sometimes um and it it doesnt seem fair and i i know a lot of people do make money um you know in in good investments and things like that but i think thats a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a whole not a whole lot of work laughter laughter i agree with you i do think its a lot of luck and i dont like that part of the finance you know whatsoever i dont know but like what i was saying about the social security thats real you know it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes and then the more i think about it the more i think im paying in to something that i granted you know im paying for my grandparents but im never going to see that social security is going to be gone before i ever get any probably not yeah yes or whats left is not going to be worth anything um you know in terms of how you can actually use it right theyre going to pay me fifty dollars a month laughterwell yeah right but thats well and im sorry i put in much more than that you know thats right yeah yeah thats i havent heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it was that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just werent in existence and um then i it sort of calmed down i havent heard much lately but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years im sure that you have heard oh yeah yeah well um i dont know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of yeah yeah you you got to look to what they put you know you have decent roads at least laughter yeah you have to appreciate yeah what what you do get for them sometimes and um i guess its its worse you know id rather see be able see to control my money as much as i do with whats left over after taxes than to live in oh England or um some some countries where so much of it is socialized that you dont see any of that money at all thats true and so you know i guess its all relative laughter laughter its how you look at it too laughter yeah thats exactly right i like to instead of thinking how much you know that im paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you laughterknow thats right yeah and i ,taxes,3077
okay uh lets see what do you use or how do you control your money well right now we dont have a whole lot of money laughter so theres not much to control laughter um basically im usually the one that uh handles the money um vocalizednoise uh my husbands been unemployed for a little more than a year so weve kind of uh its been extremely tight but weve managed somehow um we pay the necessities and uh from there if theres anything left laughter try and save some of it but uh how you want to go ahead and say what you do yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right and uh you know your rent and whatever else and uh and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever you know and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for for miscellaneous things but one thing that weve used and its its its kind of good because it gives it gives you uh kind of a savings plan sort of and uh what it is we have a ledger you know just a a book and in it in it we have different accounts uh that lets say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something thats what would go into savings for instance uh we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories so for instance uh lets say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair uh maintenance or whatever another so youve already got it there when youve got the right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars saved for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever however you know vocalizednoise up to a hundred twenty dollars thats a good idea yeah yeah and thats how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car vocalizednoise you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that and and it seems to work  you dont just go overboard spending too much of the savings on one particular thing right right thats a good idea when we have some money well do that laughter and so it you know it seems to it it seems to work pretty good you know the the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every every month of stuff but that seems to work pretty good and uh see other things we do is just uh just try to uh just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know and uh we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that but how about you guys  well some thats there therere several things i do to save money um one is to use garage sales and we do a lot get a lot of things used and the things that we do have i try and recycle a lot you know before ill get rid of something ill look at it and think what else can i do with this and uh how else can i use this right uhhuh to solve some other problem somewhere else you know and uh that has helped a lot um and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need so that ive got it ahead of time and i dont have to go out and buy it something not on sale because ive already gotten it on sale then when the sale comes around again go ahead and stock up again well thats a good idea yeah have you gone to any of those places that uh you know like uh uh uh i guess the different names for them are like the Price Club or Sams or Sams um we have a Sams not too far away but i havent uh used it yet things like that uh theyre going to theyre building a new one thats going to be even closer and im ill probably use it when its over here even a little closer yeah ive been in a couple and it seems like you can get pretty good uh you know stretch your money there because you get the the big things you know yeah you have to buy quantity right right but um thats how you save money you know and thats and uh one of my i recently got a masters in computer systems science or computer systems and one of the things i really learned a lot was uh theres a number of programs for the computers for if you happen to have a personal computer or whatever that a lot of programs thatll help you you know budget your money and uh and uh its kind of really neat because it does a lot of things for you as far as vocalizednoise give you all your graphs and your charts and stuff and show you where youre spending money so if youre really honest about inputting everything that you spend your money on youd be you youre really surprised at like boy you know i spend a whole lot of money on like candy or something you know laughter and  yeah yeah well i think theres an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we really dont need and i think since being unemployed we vocalizednoise look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want right right and uh you have to decide how much you want and and i think uh uh ive noticed that however much money you have you can spend that much or more you know people people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards thats one thing were trying try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs right that can get you in trouble pretty quick yeah yeah if you vocalizednoise and i really like paying cash instead of checks even um we got changed to an economy account at the credit union so it costs less to use less checks  and um those are just little things you can do well that sounds that sounds pretty good well you have anything else to say or any other plans that you use uh i like what you say about the recycling thing looking at something before you get rid of it thats a good thats a good thing  yeah i uh having a garage sale yourself helps we just had one this last week laughterend oh did you well we did we did something like that too we recently moved here from California and uh we had a there was like a bargain fair you know where everybody brings stuff to sell oh yeah and uh and there really we made a lot of money i was surprised a lot of baby clothes we sold and stuff that we dont need any more and stuff but uh but uh i was surprised yeah thats a good way to make some money yeah when you cant use it any more yeah thats right thats uh i think uh learning how to do things yourself a lot helps too like i cut everybodys hair myself oh thats good and if you can uh just watch how they do it at the uh shop or ,family_finance,3079
okay i guess were going to talk about budgets and spending and keeping laughter oh okay i dont have a set budget i just laughter know what i have coming in and i know what i have to keep in reserve in order to survive well i have i uh  i have one oh written out but just basic things but what always ruins mine each month is all these other things like car repairs and unexpected expenses yes yes yes yes the things that crop up that you didnt plan for right i i just have mine all written up if i didnt have any of those it would laughtercome laughterout to laughterthat laughter so thats why we always have to have a reserve somewhere so we can not be caught shorthanded right right i also keep uh all my finances i make a big chart at the beginning of the year and each column you know is each different expense and then i add them up at the end of each month so that and i post it kind of from my checkbook i see and then i add them up at the end of each month so i do know exactly what i spent and then i can look at my chart and see what i spent where uhhuh do you and thats the way i do mine do you kind of forecast yourself for the year or not make a forecast of what you think your expenses and then compare what the actual costs are yeah i can do that because i can add across then for twelve months you know on my chart i can add it up at the end of the year and see what i but you but again when you say budget that budget that i make thats supposed to work for the year it doesnt have all these extra things on it that laughtercome up like we spent eighteen hundred dollars last month getting our shower redone you know things was your shower pan out of kilter um oh we had a leak and the tiles just all started falling in oh my uh and this the third this house is eighteen years old and its the third time its happened the first time it was the pan and then the next time it was termites and then this time i think it was just some kind of a leak laughterbut laughteranyway anyway uh our house is to an age that that a big part thats not budgeted is have to use for repairs you know it really is a shame the way they build houses though because you can go over to England and look at those castles that are four and five hundred years old and theyre like you know so like a Rock of Gibraltar theyre so steady and steadfast and just rigorous constructed and our homes here in the States you know theyre made to a good wind would blow them over yeah laughter laughterthats true which is really a shame for the to speak of the building industry like that yeah yeah things do i mean the all wear out fast well much faster than they did when i was a child growing up i mean those houses were made to last now where did you grow up in Detroit um uhhuh okay so youre used to homes with basements and that sort oh yes solid foundations and wet plaster walls and hardwood floors and the whole bit yes well maybe homes for have always been built more sturdier in the north than down here because of the snows and winters and everything well i see i dont have anything to base that on because i was an adult when i moved here ive been in Dallas about twelve years and you know i havent really seen um a quality home even the homes that i see that are that theyre building out in North Dallas where theyre paying just thousands and thousands of dollars for theyre using plywood on i mean pressed board on the roof if i was the buyer id have a fit theyre not even using a pure wood product plywood plywood is that what what well no not not plywood pressed wood you know where they take all these remnants and press them together i wouldve i would have a complete fit if i saw my new home being built like that i guess so many people dont know that much about construction that they know what these things to look for i think we should have steel girders in our homes and therere not i i just um its just its ridiculous i just feel very very disheartened about about the way i see the building industry go no wonder you know the hail damage is so extensive and and things like that where it shouldnt be and your homes if they catch catch on fire they go up within a matter of minutes rather than you know uh it takes a long time for the fire really to get a hold oh yeah yeah we because theyre inferior theyre using inferior inflammable material our uh the house next door to us burned a few years ago but what really got it we had wood shingles all wood shingle roofs in this neighborhood well see they should have known that they should have made uh they should have dipped them and and prevented and made them fire proof they they knew you know they knew i mean you know where are our engineers at our building engineers well you know maybe maybe there should just be um laws or something that the builders specifications that they have to do well yeah there are codes well its their the building codes and the building laws are too slack thats whats wrong theyre not stringent enough theyre not after the consumer theyre after the builder theyre protecting the builder and not the consumer oh definitely right yeah i know it well i guess weve kind of gotten off the subject laughterhavent laughterwe laughter we should have been talking about laughter home repairs laughter no yes we did we we got caught we kind of oh dear i hope we we dont dont get in trouble well if but as far as a budget goes i do not have a budget i just know what my income is and i have X number of dollars um dedicated to a savings program and X number of dollars for contribution and but thats automatically in my brain so its not written down on paper im so used to it that um well i guess the thing we do if were when were short we have one of these uh line of credit uh accounts at uh First City in Richardson its like for ten thousand so if so if we like we had to buy a new roof a few months ago that was four thousand dollars uhhuh uhhuh well something like that we put on that line of credit and then we try to you know pay it off is that as we can you know thats how thats what we do with laughterwith with things we cant afford i guess you would laughtersay so your uh so the ,family_finance,3084
okay um well do you uh keep a family budget or or do you have some no i dont use a family budget my father whos very old has kept one his entire life and i probably rebelled rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out oh interesting on a very strict percentage yes well um we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and you know and never have gotten out of it i cant really say that its a formal budget its more just a a pretty um a fairly uh accurate accurate um recording of what i spend and what i think im going to have to spend and i think it makes much more sense and ive recently uh gotten out of debt and everything and ill probably keeping start keeping a little better track of it i just uh yeah yeah spent whatever came in and and uh didnt never knew what came in what went out but uh just you know like about like the government runs yeah laughter sounds real similar laughter so i think its probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record but my dads was so precise that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something thats what it was spent and oh my yeah that was put over there and i mean uh of course hes from the depression and uh so uh you know its his life but uh i i would i think itd be smart if somebody would keep uh some sort of a plan that works for them yeah i think youre right um well it it whats been sort of interesting to us is to um it because since i have uh pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look and its real fun to just see what how things have changed over the years uh for instance yeah it is  im a historian and my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty seven and my goodness but he burned the ones from twenty seven to fifty i couldnt believe he did that but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present but oh dear to look to have looked back into the twenties and thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that but uh oh yes well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things uh not long long ago i guess its been a couple of years vocalizednoise in an old trunk that she had and she came upon a budget a budget book that shed had back in the thirties uh when they it was the late well i guess it would have been i take that back it must have been the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time and it was just fascinating uh fascinating to see how little things cost i mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know of course its all relative of course but i know right right uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know for a price pair of shoes was uh like five dollars and laughter i know well even in nineteen sixty three i found a a record that i had vocalizednoise had traveled in Europe a lot and i what id paid for hotels and a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty and thats really crazy because thats about thirty years ago oh isnt that something really oh that is that is really really something oh but but of course its just what the marketll bear and if people if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten you know yeah thats true yeah thats good thats right thats exactly thats just good old economics working laughter right right that well uh weve tried to uh instill some sense some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night night and day and our son could care less about a budget and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost she almost just sounds like your father i mean she has everything planned so closely closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a laughterloop umhum umhum yeah well then you never know how theyll one they they may switch flip flop when they get to be uh older well older the other one may be very careful and right yes she may marry somebody and of course itd be good because if you marry somebody a little loose then shell have that stability of watching uh you should have one in the in the in the house and i think i think thats true i and and its i kind of think thats sort of what happened in our house because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married and i was i was really diligent about that i always putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working in and out of college and uh that really paid off because when it time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in in fairly good good shape financially as far as not having many major debts and yeah thats about the way it is here if it hadnt been for my wife i would have probably been in debtors prison if we had one but uh what does you husband do now uh he is an engineer hes uh an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his PhD so we had a a lot of lot of years of budgeting laughter oh yeah you have to do it when youre in school my wifes still in school getting her doctorate and so i it it and ive got and you know yeah when you uh yes well im working im working on my masters degree now so in fact this last year we had three two both of the children were in college our son has a year left our daughter graduated this year and im uh just about ready to finish my masters degree so um um weve had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us oh i i know we had three in college plus my wife so that was four so were both in the same but uh yep yeah you know exactly what its what its like then and its uh yeah yeah which you learn i guess you figure that thats an investment that is um really a invaluable invaluable umhum yeah and thats the best one yeah with education you cant take that away from you thats right so its its one that you can live through and i think that thats way we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school is that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know that that it was worth it to save and then not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it so uh it really makes it easier but uh well ive enjoyed talking with you Jay yeah thats true yeah i have enjoyed talking with you Kathy and i i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me im interested in that well if i had your address id send you i am also in the

okay uh do you work outside the home no i dont okay wow laughter have you have yes uhhuh do you have i uh no not actually laughter okay well yes i do in fact i am at work right now uh and so let me take the lead uh Angela uh i think what is really important uh  of course salary is very important because thats why you are working is for your its for the money but job satisfaction to me is also uh very important in having a job and uh one of the things that uh she um asked us to discuss was benefits uh im assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you okay and so we could we could talk about uh that path you know how important you think his benefits are and and and uh how important you think they are and if what would you like to see increased in his benefits like uh perhaps uh he has uh the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family uh uh and how much coverage uh it provides and also your hospital coverage and uh um probably dental how important you think that would be right i i think that job wise benefits are important just as important as salary is because they and course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course right right exactly exactly especially when you have a family with children and you are always going to the doctor for and they always have surprises for you with children you know and so its it is uh they always do we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small uh uh business yeah i think any any even if your insurance policy is not the greatest you would still have something exactly you vocalizednoise you wouldnt be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself also  for working women uh i think a lot of the companies should start providing for day care in the in the in the building they are getting a handle on that in fact uh my oldest daughter is uh is uh a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and thats one of the areas that she is working on to have uh uh a day care center for the individual the children of the of the nurses that are staffing the facility and that is true in many many areas of you know uh job titles and professions like in in may case i have three children from ages nine to two and it its just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would be making would be going to day care it would it would be just futile and it it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center which is not right exactly and they would not have the quality and they would be deprived of their mother yeah no i understand that totally besides which it would be easier uh theres a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner and to go to work oh i hear yes thats true you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care and if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child or you know and take your breaks with your children or something yes do you do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting do you think that would be i think that i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper i do too right that you thats right with the company than than having to go with the company helping our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it thats correct thats right i agree with that i think it would be really really great that would be fair i do uh and how how do you feel about uh lets see eye care eye care is good i dont im not sure i dont think we have that on our policy but uh we vision i guess its called vision care it would be great i mean the glasses that the exams themselves are not expensive its the glasses it depends on who has examines your eyes yeah thats true if you have an ah optometrist or an ophthalmologist theres a vast difference in those two uh professions right now like my well like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got well she does not have it but she is like on the verge of it or something her eyes are changing and she has to be tested periodically and and those are expensive tests oh okay so yes they are now i think your insurance covers her on that but you know for something like that it that thats just as bad as a medical you know that that right thats critical because shes in need of it so often yes and you know we have uh needs in our life that are unique to us and you know people have needs in their life that are unique to us to them i mean we are all different so now i i would like to see bettlebetter better dental insurance to me was that our beep yeah well no thats my other phone oh huh so thats it thats okay my that phone is ringing to an empty desk and shes on vacation laughter so its okay okay but with with the three children um orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic care thats very expensive because on on a lot of the dental insurances they dont cover that well for the the orthodontal stuff yes thats true orthodontic work is terribly expensive especially when you have a lot of uh problems with the children teeth and yes it is and you have to really get them when they are young in order to have uh not uh a decent uh smile when theyre uh fifteen sixteen years old i know two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight uh because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth and we footed the bill because there wasnt any such thing and when they were young right my middle child needs to have uh orthodontic hes because his his pallet is squared not rounded oh uhhuh and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know uhhuh major right but just enough that his bite is off a little bit and its like four hundred dollars and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it well i tell you i  i just read an article in the paper about what they are doing i think it was an ad in in our publication at Texas Instruments where they are breaking the jaw and lining the jaw up with the teeth its its less painful and less expensive that sounds like it would hurt more i i know but its its its uh easier on the patient in the long run which amazed me oh gosh i i would much rather that do that to myself than make my five year old laughtergo laughterin and do it that would kill me ,job_benefits,3092
there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary boy i i i dont know thats a thats a a tough one uh uh and its uh i suppose its its changes as uh as perception my perception changes of of what uh im getting gypped on laughter this week or this month uh uh that week right uh were just uh going through uh uh well theres a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh if i step back im not sure id id uh say that what what about you well um i uh right now im into a weird situation im a graduate student and uh oh okay uh i dont have that many benefits per se laughter okay but but on the other hand vocalizednoise one of these days youll be out looking for a sort of get yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um uh i think health insurance is real real important uh ive ive ive ive discovered i mean even in my case its sort of theyre really um a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical vocalizednoise they they force you to buy here now im covered by my wifes anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester right okay for uh mandatory so thats sort of annoying that im paying for something im not getting in that case id rather that that went to something else and and yeah and the benefits youre getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wifes right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think theyre very theyre excellent physicians there so through my wifes HMO weve registered for them as our primary care physicians so we go there anyway so theyre theyre so if they were to bill which which i believe they dont but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but theyre not thank God um but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i dont know if thats really a deciding factor for many people on a job i dont you know uh yeah i it uh the that that is thats a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there its uh if i remember right you well if they they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i im coming up on ive been at TI now uh uh coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah thats a that that is a a a negative but uh oh wow  so thats the real  but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh yeah i mean i dont you know i dont i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but theyre pretty good about it if she wants other time off they vocalizednoise you know usually let her well that that yeah thats uh that thats the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh thats the the the uh yeah that thats uh why it hasnt made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour oh really and uh and but uh there wasnt uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh the the actual vacation time per year probably isnt that isnt that much different but uh thats oh thats a but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think thats thats going through changes everywhere to uh the theyve uh uh thats reasonable i think gone through a couple years ago here where they uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now theyre in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that just routine visits uh ah they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah weigh are see such of things yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that thats good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance and in other cases its actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you dont work for somebody thats got enough clout to to uh uh give you you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh youre youre not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh im not im not sure it my uh one of the phrases i use is that that its moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where its the government that decides here its its uh at least us who decides yeah uh and but it but its the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share youll youll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh uh i i dont know in in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh although ive ive been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctors doing the right thing to make me get better right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that thats the yeah and ,job_benefits,3107
the budget seems to be oh on a number of peoples minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didnt spend money here and there i hear them talk about uh cutting what they call aid to some foreign countries and people dont understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh you start giving a country uh x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever you wish you know you would say well youre not acting right were gonna withhold it or youre not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever and the governments been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and im not sure if the general public uh thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little far fetched and not necessarily for the common good uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few and usually those who are um rich anyway laughteror have enough have enough money to attend those kind of functions so its vocalizednoise thats a a controversy of course theres only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy millions a bit laughterand its something so what would you do or cut or change in the budget um i agree with you on the international aid and um i dont think a lot of people realize too on we cant live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um  uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia i know a lot of people feel that weve given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um its also in our countrys interest um to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like were the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come laughter to lend us a hand but um i do think uh  vocalizednoise this is a hard area im theres some areas that i feel uh need a lot of work um  and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that were in but unless they start working on it um it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable but im not sure exactly what practical uh steps uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think thats our future if we um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um its thats an area i would not want cut there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyones heard the stories of the several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um thereve been some gross laughtererrors most of the the national or the federal dollars that go toward any project uh people tend to want accountability but they dont want the socalled bigger government so they they wanna have fewer government employee ,budget,3172
does tend to get  talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how theyre collected is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments well i think i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right but we dont have that anymore do we no not uh not near to the extent that it was i didnt think so theyve even cut you know who can have an IRA that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now theyve cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair right i usually use that as a preface to you know its okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive good incentive but since theyre not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way but they already tax us i mean where we live  its eight almost eight and a half percent tax right but couldnt they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make oh and then some laughter and then some and then some so then youd have a tendency to be taxing uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year youd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldnt tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing are you talking about doing away with income tax doing away with everything except for yeah all forms all forms of it including i dont think well were already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i dont think that would generate enough money well youd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent oh i see what youre saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um yeah so if you took the money out of one off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that dont report income now so if they dont report income then you wouldnt get that percentage well if theyre not reporting the income now theyre still not paying it so whats the point if if well if if its left in the hands of the grocer he doesnt care whether you know this guy giving him the money you know pays taxes or not but hes going to have to pay that percentage see what im saying well when a guy comes in to you know hes got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax lets say and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased because the grocer doesnt want to hide it for him whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and its up to the government to prove him wrong oh i see what youre saying but if we had to have an income tax which theyre never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay see so im saying theres what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPAs and right laughter right HR Blocks would be out of laughter of a job but uh so you you tax yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah thats a rational way to do it i never have understood why they dont do that yeah it it does seem and no one can explain it laughterto laughterme it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they they had some good ideas but they dont seem to be following them anymore no no  i dont know i i guess theres never a an answer nobody ever asks thats true thats true not being an economy major i guess theyd never ask me anyway laughter they dont ask me at all laughter i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they dont pay anything and i question their i i i just think that theyve made it almost a joke all the deductions in the the way you can send ,taxes,3177
something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didnt uh get too much built up on it that we didnt know it was out there but we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off which  which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card yeah its its strange that that i guess to draw new customers ive seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine i cant imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have you know eighteen percent some of them even higher and uh uh you know it its some of them are almost uh usurious the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your all your purchases back but they had a uh a users fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee if you use it at a uh a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so laughterthat would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh that were with does charge you if you happen to use outside theirs but thats theres so many of theirs that it doesnt matter i i hardly i never have that i know of yeah its like my uh ATM card  if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and its down in the lobby ive got a these automatic teller machines then its very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars for that transaction which i thought gosh and if you happen vocalizednoise to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least thats thats something huh the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so theres theres several opportunities to use the uh card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and its real convenient just to run up and get cash fact its the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh im with so thats nice to have those around and i only drive ten miles to work so its kind of a uh one of those situations where theyre theyre all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them  do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i i guess i i dont know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasnt too bad it wasnt but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had yeah thats well thats thats not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me and uh you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money laughterbefore it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldnt have been uh quite so expensive i guess thats the way they planned on doing it i cant imagine what i its been several years i cant imagine what i did to uh i do seem to recall oh i i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh gosh i dont know what it i dont think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places places were closed it was after hours as it were and there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open ,credit_card,3180
 go ahead what do you have to say on the subject well i am a tax preparer myself so i do about five hundred income taxes a year in fact i even do television and radio shows here in the Dallas market uh regarding income taxes make sure every one pays the  right amount and i am convinced that uh most people try to humum cheat ever so slightly on their tax returns only because uh the way the IRS does things theyre not gonna give you any breaks i mean they they encourage you to cheat because if you should get audited theyre gonna get you for everything and and some more on top of that and then theyre gonna tax you on that for or theyre gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to  thats right no see believe it or not im one of these honest guys but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it if im not presently working outside of the home if i return to work believe it or not with our state income tax our city income tax city we live in and city we work laughterin i would have lost and with social security i would have lost forty eight cents on every dollar that i earned easily easily and well easily just laughteras laughteryou laughtersaid and i sat down and thought about it and i should be in a pretty good position because i dont have little kids any more that i need sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would distruptdisrupt disrupt our travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said its not worth it im not working any more it just isnt worth it and you get frustrated and yet i dont know what the Texas uh the Texas rules are well see well Texas we are a community property state so we have some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate property state such as uh where you in Ohio but do you pay a state income income tax we we do not have state income taxes yet but we see it on the horizon it hadnt hit here yet but we do have you dont um they start with one percent and then laughterthey laughterget laughteryou laughterevery laughtertwo laughteryear yeah but how much do you pay in sales tax  uh sales tax we pay seven percent okay were at eight and a fourth right now youre so youre higher but you get outoftowners on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good true true as uh the income tax whats not fair is paying in the city you live in right now were living where there is a reciprocity so if you do pay more in the city youre working you dont owe your city anything and this year well my husbands actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because our city is a little bit less but are you of the fact that when you prepare your tax return now obviously if you have an error in the IRSs favor theyre going to be very quick to come back to you and say hey you owe this much more tax but if there is an error in your favor they do not come back to you and say oh you get a refund they oh absolutely and much less they dont pay you an interest yeah so you know if whats fair for the goose is good for the gander and unfortunately the IRS is saying you know we have screwed yall so many times thats why so many tax payers are starting to cheat more and more which is a shame but i think the IRS has brought it on themself because theyre not being very helpful to those who have made errors and i think if they would i think if they would come back and say hey look this is wrong this is the way it should be done were gonna give you some refunds and so forth and actually show an honest effort to be good on both sides of the fence we wanna collect as much tax we also wanna give back as much tax i i think that youd have a better feeling and youd have a lot better tax returns being done well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and ive done it with transfers and sale of property but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it lets go see a CPA well and yet if you went to visit five different CPAs youd get five different answers thats what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment laughteryou you have excelled she said i cannot find one thing to pull out that you havent already pulled and i said well i do keep records all year long as i go one on twice a month one on i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients id love to have laughter laughter well thats what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because i said well ive got all everything ,taxes,3192
 uh what is what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money well i  we talk about it but im usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh oh i see thats how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it um yes yeah laughter i dont mind the spending its just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so well i dont work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than whats coming in i have to go back to work so i i laughtermanage i see well im im at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh no do you actually follow a budget  well we  pretty well do um  several years we didnt and we found that we just werent making the most of of what we had and so we we um  set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then whats left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although were not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs well thats pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown and so i really dont have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to laughteryou laughterknow get things together for them and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently uh i dont always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and id put things on there that i think im not laughtergonna laughtergive laughterto and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point were in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to so im still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how were going to pay for it ahead and we do not buy used ah new cars uh do you get into the car  well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now its just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car um do you think that its wiser to buy used we do for us very much so in fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just dont go to a new car you know whatever and i said look you guys are all into car payments we havent had car payments for so many years i love it this way and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldnt it be great if we could find another one just like it believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is its the same color oh no oh wow and so everybodys saying youre kidding you have two cars the laughtersame and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again laughter thats right laughter i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and its an eighty five and so i said hey this was a cinch weve paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years vocalizednoise or next year probably do you um buy from dealers or from individuals generally from dealers and uh it depends because i dont like to sell what were trading in to an individual uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying dont bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away youre gonna get one shot at us we will laughteryou laughterknow and they say well youre kidding you know i no this is the price were going to give you out the door we dont wanna hear about taxes ,family_finance,3195
hello hello hi boy it took forever to find somebody laughter oh laughter well im glad you found me good well im my names Gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards yes my name is Carolyn okay well if youre ready then uh okay ill just let you start ill vocalizednoise okay ill press one okay well im not laughter this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall laughter  i just find it so easy to to charge something when i dont have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so i think theyre kind of dangerous i think they are too and unfortunately um we use ours in we dont use them all the time but we use them like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that laughter but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half yeah me too laughter i think sometimes when you look at the interest that youre paying on them um thats what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really get a lot more stuff laughter if you were just able to pay outright for it yeah thats true thats true seems just like our society is so um pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this theyre really trying to get you into that uh situation because they know theyve really got you then thats right yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and its just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well thats probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on at that point and then it seems like  takes forever to pay that off laughter laughter its funny that uh weve got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago and we still owe i mean i i think like half  of the amount that they cost in the first place its just uh you know you just never never get get it out and uh thats thats real irritating to have laughter it sure is we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards and the interest on the loan was cheaper  than it was you know to just have that we havent done it lately we probably need to do it again well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure well give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck and they said sure thats no problem but you know why dont we consolidate your bills and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and its gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didnt realize at the time uh until several months later that we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didnt you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again oh no laughteryeah so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem  so we were paying like twice  oh um  so we didnt ever made that mistake again luckily  but uh were definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this its real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church laughtertalking about debt and things like that i just its so so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car and uh if you could stick to that you know wed get rid of a lot of indigestion laughter and everything else yeah   yep laughter sure thats true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over her yeah what a mess you are  oh dear oh so i dont know if i if i i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and so he said okay well keep it and then we werent smart enough to not use it so  you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though its just like keep now we just dont ,credit_card,3196
 okay ill let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours laughter no i i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible well thats thats good laughter especially for these times and uh and its its sort sort of always worked uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can laughter i guess have self control well thats a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didnt keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she wont quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what shes buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldnt think about and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that werent supposed to be every month well yeah i i couldnt probably be bothered doing doing that uhhuh  thats what i mean it was a hassle laughter every month and and every since uh well weve been married almost thirty years now but um my my husband got paid once a month so laughter you learn to get through laughter you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh laughterthats thats kind of hard laughter but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldnt like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way dont you no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isnt anything left to spend anyway well thats true what were in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely and were going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next laughtermonth well yeah we we tried to to to or we are paying them off now or there was a time when maybe we didnt pay all of them off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is yeah were not there yet thats right thats right and for most of uh i mean im a substitute teacher and ive only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so theres only been really one working  and uh  umhum same here yeah it it works for me but i cant see that it it would work for probably the majority of people well i could say its kind of you know thats thats good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have to you know what im saying and so that thats the difference there where sometimes like i know if weve had an especially bad month and were just almost getting down to payday then i think if we could really budget we tried one time i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadnt had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener umhum yeah umhum it it is when you do it that way vocalizednoise laughter uhhuh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes ill spend less on groceries but well go out so its kind of hard to say this is how much youre gonna spend going out for fun this is how much youre gonna spend its kind of hard do you well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldnt you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks yeah yeah right laughter right oh how nice ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the laughterwhat minuscule amount i made but that way you just didnt put it on your credit card and and it was paid for laughter with well thats good and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah vocalizednoise yes and so i think that thats difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um i think so too so if youre out like in a department store and theres a sale youre just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that thats excellent thats what im working toward i think youre probably much ahead of me there and im working on it and i never worried about saving money because we just were in the savings plan at work and they took it out so same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you dont have to go through the company to get laughter you know yeah i uh well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh that came up yeah and we didnt buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my were looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars and they were mainly used cars well thats the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasnt worth it from the day after so yeah so you know weve been laughterrather rather frugal in that rather frugal well that thats gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess weve completed do you think weve been here ten in that respect yeah  well each each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh ,family_finance,3200
 how are you doing  doing good okay well doing great i had a while to think about it so why dont i start and you can chip in when you feel like it laughter go right ahead uh when we were first married we didnt think we needed a budget and and i think it was fine with the two of us we just kind of spent as we wanted and seemed like we got paid off enough that it would cover laughter laughter now now how long ago was it that you got married oh its been about nine years so nine years okay then when we actually got out of school and employed and laughter we only started getting paid once a month and we found that you really laughterhad laughterto laughterbudget things or by the last week or two you were broke so thats probably when we started budgeting and ever since we just you know what type of budget do you have oh i dont laughterknow no i mean i mean how do how do you keep do you actually look to see what you have spent each month or do you plan on what youre gonna spend for the month or i mean how do you do your budget i probably plan what were going to spend each month i mean we get paid and i deduct all that were going to have you know all the bills at first and then i set aside so much for utilities that we need and so much for this and then we have a certain amount each week to work with for groceries and and lots of times i go over that amount laughterbut well see now for myself im a CPA so needless to say my budget is probably  extremely well fine tuned uh ive been married now for nineteen years and every month since the vocalizednoise the day that i was married i have had a budget i take all the checks that i write and all the deposits that i make and i put into my computer and it spits out a beautiful financial statement and from the financial statement i can see each month exactly what i have spent to see what i have made and see if theres any profit in leftovers so i can tell if on a month by month basis if im spending too much and if i am i just simply go to the wife and say okay laughter time to cut it off you know laughter this is how much you spend on this youd better not do it anymore laughter well its its its you know our budgets so much and you can just you can look at it and you can see hey that on clothing we have spent on this particular month so much more than the average i mean was just way out of proportion right and thats usually about schooltime laughter laughter for us it always seems to be Christmas time and yeah Christmas and summer uh so i have these financial statement and i look at them month by month by month oh yeah and i can tell you to the penny how much we have spent in groceries how much we spend in utilities how much we spend on entertainment vacations thats great car car expenses whatnot and we know what we should be spending and uh now for my wife shes a schoolteacher her income is fixed for for myself i own my own CPA practice so we have a uh uh a floating you know my income is not fixed it can go up it can go down but youve got the generalities you know what its about its going to be and so what we look at is is to see behind us because now i do not plan in advance i can not tell you what were gonna be spending money on in the month of November i dont i i dont know but i can tell you what we did spend in September and as i see that i can then say okay here we are in October uh so then you know were were a little bit short this you know last month we we spent way too much so we need to hold back lets not spend anything this month or next month so thats how i do my budget um thats great i i break mine down quite a bit i keep whats called a nonbalanced checkbook but i put all like fifty dollars away for clothes for the month or fifty dollars for savings bonds and you know and then when i feel like it i deduct that or laughter so its kind of a different way to do it but there was a time when i remember i always wanted to put fifty dollars into my savings account but now it just a matter i want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that i have you know but uh i i i will not allow myself to have a credit card we do and that that i now i i do have a credit card but i dont ever pay or have a balance of more than i can uh payoff no we dont either we never we use it to float mainly yes i use it to float extremely especially on big purchases or around Christmas and yes i i enjoy that forty five day float very very much but uh i i have not paid an interest a penny of interest in the last ten years yes laughter yeah we i bet we havent for two or three years or you know once in a while you you have something come up that is more than you can handle or or you thought you could handle and you have to leave a little balance but we havent for ages either curiosity only only because im a CPA uh how do you budget for the April fifteenth or do yall always have a refund or so far weve always had refunds we you know have we have three children and that seems to really help and we probably dont make enough right laughternow laughterso laughter and i i assume do you own a house but  i think if we did see that we were starting ,family_finance,3262
 well i dont know if theres gonna be a solutions to the US budget well i know its in pretty disastrous shape for sure its only getting worse exponentially it seems um yes exactly theres uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybodys pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition that oh which state is that uh state of Minnesota so theres the potential that perhaps you know the US budget might wanna take a look at its uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well lets freeze wages i mean everybodys doing it so it isnt like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shirtshort thats got to be very short term  right and and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where theyre spending the money and not so much as saying  well were spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars  right and it was just laughteri laughtermean you can go to Kmart and buy them for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats so yeah definitely i think that theres probably a lot of so it gives you an idea that waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place sure sure so i mean there was um people at Stanford who were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to um for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was and i think that that may be more widespread than we think sure than well than wed like to think but  but then you know its something thats hard to enforce too im sure umhum it sure is the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know theyre getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in laughtercongress the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers money for that and its a real big crunch uh of course when they get caught then theyre you know theyre guilty of course but uh during that time im sure theres hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them well thats right the i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but im not sure that thats really that much of the problem i mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much you know at a million dollars a pop for Patriot missiles exactly and i i dont think uh its ended up being i mean it gave people jobs but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after theyre done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use i mean it was kind of like okay well do this during this point and time but after that thats you know um they didnt wanna do it anymore so a lot of things that theyre saying that theyre no longer gonna be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so i dont know  okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening okay all right you too byebye uhhuh thanks bye now ,budget,3270
so do you have an opinion on credit cards um i do laughter you do what do what do you think about them i think they get a lot of people in trouble yeah definitely i have one right now and um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldnt get laughter yeah and then you dont stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you dont stop to think about it i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble oh my goodness and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a Visa card and i never use them unless i need to  so thats good yeah yeah id i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldnt pay it in full every month that id have to rip it up so but they thats a good idea stops all them interest rates and interest rates arent none too shallow these days anyway yeah that  but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know we have im in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech  and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot umhum i have i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out laughter and they they cant do anything but work to try to pay them off and and and like one of my friends  yeah she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she does she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because shes going to school and and so i mean thats just enough to pay rent and buy like laughterthirty five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twenty yeah you have i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all shes paying is interest on hers every month yeah something like that it just seems crazy to to me but  well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and she was making like i dont know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month  so and that was before we got married so  but its you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and its its come out pretty good now we have a eighteen year old thats fixing to get out of high school and go to college and oh really thats the first thing he wanted was it Visa card oh my goodness so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick laughter i bet you know so yeah im i dont know im about sick of mine right now i dont but i think theyre too readily accessible and theres too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you draft get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but thats a lot of pain and hassle when you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh we couldnt afford everything we didnt have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need vocalizednoise exactly yeah my parents are really good about not using credit cards they are against it laughter i dont think they like the fact that i have one either i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldnt have the problems we have course we wouldnt have the retail market we have either so i guess theyd trade one for the other i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other well thats good im it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so yeah im nineteen im twenty right now so just going to school and are you yeah  and working so all right it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them and laughter on my credit card i didnt didnt have the money to do it yeah its pretty easy it sure is so do you just have two kids or uh we have a eighteen year old a seventeen year old and a seven year old oh really im from Plano Texas oh are you but right now im out in Provo Utah going to BYU so are you a youre a Mormon then yep laughter all right but this is a extra long one whats that hey theyre giving us a lot of time laughter oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays vocalizednoise yeah have you done a lot of this uh fifteen or twenty i guess oh really oh yeah do you do it every day i try to every day i uh i get calls at work i get calls at home so ,credit_card,3275
 okay ive got a you know i have a real good method of starting to get the budget balanced again and thats get half of the government rid of the half the government payroll  i think that would probably  uh be very possible and and and we really wouldnt feel it in our laughterservices not all i you know i dont know if youve ever been to Washington DC yes i have uh you youve seen that which was on there and the offices and in light of these uh hearings weve all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed they really dont laughterhave enough to keep them busy and keep their noses at in their own business and what theyre doing and the other thing is uh besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid  i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us  i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget uh again being just a voter voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman i dont think theres too much that im gonna be able to do about it but  i believe in taking an active part in politics so well i one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the um  regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income and then  the uh corporate yeah industries just dont seem to not pay proportionally  i think that that would would help a lot i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things but  i dont know its just hard to  hard to take um you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use and uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction  yeah they dont they dont seem to well i really think the biggest problem and then the Taft Rudman Act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what theyre doing  i mean this nonsense thats coming through now about uh uh lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to to boost the economy because people have no more money is its it its ridiculous if they dont laughterhave laughterthat laughtermoney now bringing in less is not gonna help the problem as far as the government not not gonna help its never never helped my my personal laughtersituation laughteri i cant say it would help theirs either laughter yeah and thank God we dont operate our budget the way they operate theirs or wed all be in in dire trouble laughter were were being serious  but thats uh  yeah i dont know what were gonna be able to do about it but i guess its been around so long that its sort of like our mortgages i dont ever expect to pay mine off before i die so i guess laughterwhy laughtershould laughterthe laughtergovernment laughtertry vocalizednoise laughter oh laughter isnt thats the way theyre thinking these days anyway it seems seems to be i you know i it really does bother me when i think about vocalizednoise you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh a national problem that we cant seem to find an an answer to it i i dont know i i dont think it ever will really i maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense really if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic you know intergovernmental intergovernmental or interUnited States type programs that i wouldnt really mind i i believe in paying my share and i dont mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that  people are entitled to but i just i just sometimes feel like im being used  but uh  again i dont think well be able to do anything about it so  well that thats quite possible i guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit or itll just totally get even more out of control but i  i dont know yeah bite the bullet it sounds like you have a baby there yeah i i do shes a were not feeling too well over here so that  yeah oh really  oh thats a shame shes not the one going to Washington huh no no shes  i dont think i could part with her oh laughter laughter laughterokay okay Jerry  okay weve probably been on long enough they didnt cut us off but i think thatll probably do it so it was nice talking to you  okay well thanks bye bye  okeydoke byebye ,budget,3279
 credit cards is one of my laughter wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or i got rid of mine about uh oh its been about four years ago now and uh went on a strictly cash basis uh sometimes its inconvenient but it is so much better for me it is because i i am the type that will always find an laughteremergency laughteroh me laughtertoo but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy and im not paying the high interest rates thats what kills you on those credit cards because its so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well ill just pay off the whole balance and then i wont owe any and then something comes up you know and well ill just pay the minimum well you just do that forever oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards youre not getting anywhere because youre paying your interest every month and thats all youre doing no youre paying interest and with our Visa thats really high interest were in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards so that somehow we can get ahead on that you know ive ive thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days yes pay the balance at the end of the month umhum right and just for ID purposes but its become such a way of life oh it has like i say it was so convenient and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card they laughteri laughterknow like you paid that one off now heres laughteranother when really youre paying a loan for the other one uh right so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and ive ive been able to buy as much or more by just going cash and like i say it was tough because its a really its a habit it is because you think oh ill get this and just pay it off later or you know youll think okay ive got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something you think well ill just put this one thing on it well you dont do that once you start you know youre going to have a bill coming in anyway might as well just yeah like you said theres a lot of things that i could probably do without that i dont do without because i have the credit card you know and uh and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into uhhuh yeah uh my husband and i just moved from South Dakota to um Plano Texas and uh that was the thing that helped helped us get down here and thats what were trying to get down on that because the credit card helped us move because we had just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving expenses but um now were in the process of trying to get that down too but it it did help in that kind of a situation but um well you know there are times when you know it is but i ive been laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards oh really youre youre stuck i would well you know it it really helped that i didnt have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them i would have lived on them yeah because you didnt have any other income and uh this way you know i i made do and uh when i was you know employed then i didnt have all that that i had to go back and say well ive got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now right and that thats good thats a good feeling not to know it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase and pay cash and pay cash it was a real good feeling i bet ,credit_card,3297
um i kept a monthly budget for so long i dont have one now but laughteri laughtersort laughterof laughterknow laughterwhere laughterit is i know where my expenses are and how much i have to cover them how about you  well i dont have anything um a budget written down per se but however i i know exactly where my money goes for the most part as far as expenses yes umhum do you do  oh yeah i think in this day and time we need something like that dont we i keep hearing that were supposed to pay ourselves first and set aside our savings first are you are you able to do that  that helps doesnt it yes it does back when we were im i take it you may be past raising a family is that true that back in those other days we couldnt do that could we no other things came took priority like doctor bills and laughterthings laughterlike laughterthat umhum thats for sure  yeah  um are you planning ahead for retirement through your your uh savings and things yes you know thats interesting because i was talking at someone in the office just this morning about the retirement and what we would like to have when we retire and how were going to get there its really hard to anticipate in advance what you think youre going to need okay and then try and plan now because things come up  but i think now were at the age where its really very important  well one of the things that my husband has he he works with financial things and uh hes been trying to you know he keeps saying well we need to sit and find out how much we want and and i think thats true but like you said its hard to do one of the things that weve done towards that is um buy nursing home insurance have you all thought of that oh no i hadnt even thought about that we have investments to uh alleviate some of the cost of our old age hopefully in in terms of uh an apartment complex weve been partnership with uh some other people oh thats sounds that sounds good but its not going to provide a whole bunch of money i mean it it might might pay the utilities you know at at that point in time uh and hopefully our investments with TI will help our retirement our retirement years  well the uh if you have the retirement fund at place like that theyre usually fairly good i know mine im weve gone through some mergers and my retirement has has ended uh the plan has ended three different times this year laughter is that right thats not very encouraging is it uh no because uh of the changes that came about in the government requirements and then in uh in merger requirements  but um my husband was looking into the nursing home insurance is its its really is an investment you hope you never have you use but uh you have to be so careful of what it will pay and what it wont pay when you buy something like that in advance how can you be sure that well i guess you dont really buy into the nursing home do you oh no no its an insurance policy you buy its a policy that will pay for your nursing home should you need it it pays a set amount and uh and you talk to your insurance agent about theres special companies now that are doing it and they set them up i know ours is a set amount each year and it has a maximum amount over a thirty month period and uh it you know it has you need to read the policy and look into what it covers i guess im conscious of that because my mothers in a nursing home and uh i think we we learn from our experiences oh i think thats very true and that brings it more to home when it happens close to home yeah it does but uh i think one of the main things that we in the past always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for when we do retire and if you got that covered  i want to travel personally and i want to be able to get laughteraround oh yes oh yes dont we all right at least two three trips including a cruise every year laughter at least at least laughter at least you know well it sounds like we have some good plans anyway it would sounds like we do and uh youre youre leaning more towards investments and things like that to do yours then right i dont know how sound that is perhaps your way is is a is a more sound proposition you know  well we do that too you know you cant then the insurance policies are just things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things umhum and that will always happen oh yes but uh the investments are something that you have to plan for and get your there was some new things vocalizednoise ,family_finance,3307
 kind of options do you have in your work  uh as far as other than salary like the fringe benefits um  we get of course insurance paid  we get our sick leave and and holidays paid thats nice uh earn vacation and uh of course the work place is is uh very uh its a very nice area to work in um how about you well we dont get much laughter you dont no we dont um we have to pay for our own insurance and we you know we do get the vacation but we dont get sick pay until weve been there a year and then um i think it starts after four days if youve been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay  and uh um its real tough  the for benefits vocalizednoise the sick leave is according according to the status the way youre employed it has something to with the the way you earn your sick leave and uh you dont automatically get it depends on your status uh but uh really cant complain course the cost of uh living keeps going up salaries remain about the same and your laughtermedical benefits go up also thats the truth uhhuh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference it it surely does especially if you have a family i dont but i know when you have children and you dont it can get to be quite expensive yeah i dont have any children but i do have my husband gets um insurance paid through his company but its still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his is that right gee i i didnt realize that until hes been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that but a little better but um right now  well do you think then salary is the most important no i really dont i really think that benefits um help out a lot you know with the positions um uh benefits you know like you said are are almost better you know thats a lot of pay thats true if you thought if you think about health because i think my husband and i went to um get health insurance from an outside agency once and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month  yes to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference i know that my parents recently retired well not recently maybe the last six eight years and uh they had to uh buy a policy until something kicked in at a certain age and they were paying an enormous amount of money per month it is unbelievable in order to maintain it really is and then my mom and dad have that Blue Blue Cross Blue Shield and i think that goes up every month laughter  oh yeah that is just something else because theyre you know at the retirement age and and thats something too thats just unbelievable i know some of the companies when you do retire youre able to carry forward your retire your insurance benefits oh well that would be great wouldnt that be wonderful that would be nice laughter yes it would but uh i dont know i dont know what else would there be besides your insurance and your holiday paid and yeah my my husband gets uh life insurance dental insurance and um life and dental and and health  yeah and then he also gets legal help legal aid oh uhhuh and he also gets like hes entered into a credit union and oh yeah we have that and and all that that kind of helps out uh now thats true now weve started the EA where you can um if you have like a mental health problem a drug problem or what have you uh mentally they they will provide services for that now too and thats wonderful uh well thats nice my my sister where she works has the HMO oh yes uhhuh which is something thats you know its nice but you know its great because you pay five dollars and you go and and your medicine is five dollars but if its not an emergency you wait three months is that right well to get in umhum and that is um trying to think which one that is but im not its a real popular one hum is it like Cigna or but um Kaiser Kaiser well we have that option at at work uh to choose that or to stay with our our company that uh TI has desired to administer the insurance program but uh you can either go with the HMO or stay with with Aetna yeah i im going with Aetna thats what im im staying with well im just going to stay with the um you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and thats it but yeah because she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if its not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in  well see now your eye doctors paid for through the HMO yes yes vocalizednoise ours isnt well i dont know about the HMO but through Aetna it is not covered no its not yeah my isnt either but through the HMO it is oh thats interesting and i think eyes and and about every doctor you could about ,job_benefits,3312
 yeah they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago well theyve uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly we just uh passed a new one uh fortunately or unfortunately it doesnt go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines oh right Indianapolis got that didnt they right and uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes but uh at least we thought wed get something back from that uh how do you feel about taxes oh it seems like a big politics game like up here last year the governors up for reelection so he said the budget was fine and that the state didnt have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes and now its election time again so theyre trying to lower them so theyre just talk about lowering them but they never do they just keep raising them ive never seen taxes really go down yeah me neither well actually theyre going to here because they didnt have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and theyre gonna lower it for next year oh  i guess they figure theyre gonna make up for all they didnt get when they shouldve had a budget i hope they put that in laughterwriting laughter yeah laughter yeah they say theyre gonna lower but ill see i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation  and uh that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor cant afford it either but uh i really feel like and and i feel like you know im a middle class person income incomewise anyway and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country yeah so do i i mean im a a middle class barely but uh i dont think the rich are paying more letless not enough i think theyre paying too much  you think the rich are paying too much yeah i mean if youre in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well thats ridiculous why bother working  well i dont know many rich that dont have enough tax breaks to i mean im talking about the really rich well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make thatd be fair now ill go along with that i you know yeah no loopholes or anything everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever right now i think that would be fair and i you know  no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review its just you know you make this you pay ten percent  if you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent yeah thats the way our state tax is here i think its pretty fair  our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal  and uh  they have not gotten it  where the withholding is accurate  oh laughter so and and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what theyre supposed to and at the end of the year its not enough oh great so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out right so now you know when you sign your W form or whatever W whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state  which is ridiculous but its been that way for the last probably ten years yeah i guess you you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you dont have it to give it to them right unless you have a lot of deductions but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you statewise  and you end up owing  you know you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and youre gonna owe  fifteen hundred in the state ouch laughter  and uh its its just ridiculous but i i dont know ive they just came up with a twenty five percent increase on personal property in in Oklahoma county  and that is a chunk yeah ill say laughter  i mean twenty five percent increase ,taxes,3328
Doug you want to start laughter you dont use any credit cards i dont imagine no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and and uh use them uhhuh do you use them a lot well we try not to were on a pretty strict and tight budget we use the credit cards however when were at a situation where we dont have either the cash or the checkbook handy or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on on an item that were purchasing so oh well thats an idea thats a thought umhum yes and basically we use it mainly when were traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they dont take local they dont take out of state checks umhum umhum and so when were traveling some do you use credit cards often my husband loves them uh we do use them uh we try not to but he hes one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month laughter oh yeah well thats thats a good thing because lot of people dont pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance he he likes doing that and thats when you get into expenses yes and you get in over your head  but itll uh some people i know also try to use it as float where they buy something now and say well im going to buy this when its good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when im being paid well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and its really useful thats true and some places wont take you know like a personal check or cash even but they would take a credit card how well how are the laws in Pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in Pennsylvania for example down here when you go to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash are they the same there we yeah we have the same thing up here so we dont deal where they do that laughter we charge you know we go to places where they dont charge extra some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more thats pretty steep and uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that we just dont uh go there because theres enough other ones around that dont charge you anything extra umhum umhum because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash to me they are anyways yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill right yeah are you saying that that way youre stranded not left stranded and high and dry laughter very good youre youre one of the the good i guess good yes yeah right laughter faithful shoppers that dont get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money well i cant say we never have now we have you know at times made payments laughteron laughterour things but we try not to we try real hard well yeah well  i see that as an advantage to a credit card also that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself so i think that theres a great advantage to a credit card in those situations yeah because sometimes uh theres times when you may maybe couldnt take advantage of something but with a credit card you can umhum um do you have uh multiple credit cards and do you find that advantageous or well i think were narrowing it down actually uh uh like i said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but we really get vocalizednoise when when you get down to the nitty gritty theres probably three that we use most of the time were were actually in the same boat we like to use three uh basic credit cards that way were not confused and we dont have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes to the end of the month umhum umhum do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail oh yes once a week twice laughtera laughterweek or three times a week its not every week but but you do get them they make it very readily available almost too much so but i really i really dont like it the charges they you know we try to limit look look at that also what they charge per year right so the annual fee for to use our money you know laughter theyre charging us to spend our money and i im not real crazy about that so we try to look at that also right right yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty three percent uh based upon what the state will allow ,credit_card,3332
 okay Vic our topic is budgets do you keep a monthly budget uh i talk about doing that a lot laughter laughter welcome to the club laughter uh i i use a uh computer software program to keep track of all expenses primarily its a checking you know a check balancing program but it does categorize categorize everything oh how interesting and and it allows you to either to go in and create a budget and then compare against it or actually will sort of generate one based on you know how you categorize things over the over the months so i have all the information there um its just that i havent been very diligent at at really tracking it and following it well uh its just like the money its hard to keep track of it laughter as it goes out right right what do you do uh im a teacher and were at a my husband and i are at a stage in life where weve got one left in college so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in college laughter their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances laughter okay okay weve quit laughter um well the biggest problem that ive had or one of the one of the problems is um keeping track of cash expenditures you know expenditures uh i think that one of the things thats uh makes budgeting very hard is the convenience of automatic teller machines uh the ability to go up and get cash so easily okay i see i stopped those four years ago yeah okay well see you have control yeah oh yeah now we are you know um well were at a point in life that were looking to retirement rather than you know earnings so its gotten to the point where um yeah automatic automatic teller i only had the card and it was on my own personal account and it got way out of control very fast so i have a tendency now i take an allowance and when its gone its gone you know im finished if its gone the fifteenth of the month then its gone well thats pretty good its gone huh oh thats great and uh we have a tendency not to use cash we pay everything by check right yeah thats a good way to do it and so that way we we keep control of what were spending where its going what its going for umhum well thats great so um you know it i take a hundred dollars a month thats all i take and you know i mean i dont buy groceries out of it its my own little oh wow slush fund if you wanna call it that and thats for my little incidentals or running to the grocery store to get a you know gallon of milk or whatever umhum yeah but um after that its check only so we can you know really know where our moneys going and you know whats happening what about how are you on charge cards uh pretty good about that that the last few years anyway we did have a Master Card that got out of hand for awhile but we just just stopped using it didnt get rid of it there are times uh such as oh some mail order type things uh where its very convenient to have uh but thats really the only thing it its used for and uh one one problem i do have is with uh is it i in my job i travel a good bit and have to use my own uh credit card i dont have a business credit card so i use that and then have to file expense reports and uh it just adds another complication to properly tracking expenses knowing how much of it is reimbursed business expense uh or how much is my own expense for yeah i i use uh credit cards not for credit but just for convenience in other words i pay we pay monthly the balance due uh but we do okay yeah well this might help you because see my husband travels as well and we have separate charge accounts hes got an American Express and thats only traveling then we both have a Visa or MasterCard so anything on his American Express is his thats a pretty good way to do it and its his expense now he gave me one and if i go with him on work i only charge on that card i dont put it on my MasterCard so weve separated those two completely and i know what you mean because at first we used to intermingle our funds and we werent sure  why our bills were outrageous oh yeah its hard to be sure to be sure you know because his traveling expenses were you know i mean hes a traveling salesman so were looking at six five oh boy ,family_finance,3336
 ah i guess my personal opinion i i dont mind paying taxes necessarily i I just sometimes wonder if our moneys being used in the best way ah sometimes when i hear what what theyre even what even what the politicians are making you know when when theyre getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah  i think thats just a bit too much to be paying them ah and thats all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much its just billions of dollars thats i think is just being thrown away right right and then when you read about that theyre spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too but uh somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what were paying its not that we mind paying taxes its that were paying too much for a lousy government and i i i tend to agree with laughterthat im not really into what theyre doing per se and i think theres just too many too many levels of bureaucracy i think it can be can be managed by by less ah less levels yeah yeah well i i know anytime theres theres a big uh uh budget cut you know i work with the state and anytime theres there is a budget cut or crunches its always the small guy that that gets hurt  its never the uh the person thats making a hundred thousand there its always the person thats making the least amount and ah and and sometimes were running around there i see these these ah ah supervisors running around ah having meetings i i really dont know what they do laughteri sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything or right well i think were gonna see a streamlining in the government i just you know i i dont know what kind of uh i dont know what what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start the public in general to start saying hey this is too much were not gonna pay anymore you know were not gonna pay for this and youre out you know i think were starting to see it a little bit now but i think uh i dont know what what kind of input were gonna get from the public and how theyre gonna go about doing it because i think i think were just getting taxed way too much i mean right now were getting taxed probably probably around thirty five percent or more and thats thats you know thats me not making a whole lot of laughtermoney well they got so many hidden taxes that its really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store or something like that and youre paying a little tax here and you so yeah gas i dont know about you guys i but theres probably at least about twenty five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas and you dont realize it yeah we got a sales tax our sales tax is like eight percent and i dont know what our gas tax is i think its somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon i mean theyre hitting us up and they may not they may not raise it you know federally as much one year but then theyll raise it somewhere in the state or the or the sales tax or property tax or whatever its just i mean you can see that youre money is just not laughtergoing laughterthat laughterfar yeah well i know they say like vocalizednoise with Reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the ah deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way so i mean to me it did uh raise my taxes i mean you can tell just by just by how much money you have left over and all of a sudden i dont know its just its eating me alive yeah i i heard someone say that uh if they would just something about uh with the uh the defense budget all that extra money theyre throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars ,taxes,3360
 the topic today is credit cards yeah bummer uh why dont you go ahead and tell me some uh some of your favorite uses for a credit card if if at all thats applies no because i dont have any i gave up all my credit cards when i got my first divorce laughter its uh well i wish i was in your shoes Pat i uh i was i was i was in pretty much control of my credit cards up until the point where we moved down here from South Dakota and then uh it took my wife and i about two months to find a job so in that interim everything went on the credit card oh yeah and uh so now were slowly trying to pay it off and if i would i just keep thinking if i wouldve just been able to take that money and put it in a savings account instead of paying bills right id be uh you know id id be doing all right today but no ive got those darn credit card bills hanging over my head yeah but thats still it still helps sometimes sometimes they help and sometimes they dont you know i think if i had one id probably be maxed out well that uh laughter laughterthats laughteruh always a possibility you know because im not very what you call uh whats the word uh controllable my husband is but im definitely not one of them people well i uh while we were doing like i said we were doing all right you know wed put gas occasionally go out to eat or pick up a small gift or something you know some clothes or something but and we could always pay it off when when the bill came and when we moved down here and everything was going on the credit card i think we we got a little rampant we you know went out to eat out everything and you know wed wed have to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists the first the first month that we were here and of course everybody takes credit cards so why not it got uh it got way out of hand but thankfully were were now working to pay them off and and we havent put anything on them in a couple months oh yeah it gets bad laughter it can it sure can well what uh what do you find are some of the best advantages of credit cards if you have one major credit card you can do anything during an emergency thats true other than that then youre more or less have to have money or uh some kind of way of getting some right right so thats probably you know the best thing i can think of the the bad thing is you get accustom to them laughter thats right you can you certainly can you know so i dont know i had i was used to them and then when my me and my husband broke up and i had to pay all the bills that did it i huhuh none laughter i dont want any well i understand that you know you cant even rent a car hardly or uh get an airplane ticket without a credit card without one thats right unless you got cash money right well even if you have cash its hard to if youre under twenty five and you you have cash you still cant get still cant rent a car you have to have a credit card you cant rent a car no you cant rent a car yep umhum and that uh i dont know laughter i think the only thing that saves me there is you can rent a car through TI if i really had to rent a car okay you work with TI then okay well you dont even speaking of cash you dont get the five dollars for the phone call you just you get the gift part isnt that how that worked if youre a TI employee but other yeah yeah hum i get a little point and you get so many points and you get the little pick a little gift and thats about it well thats all right thats thats an interesting incentive we uh we wanted to do it because we werent from the south and i think we would able wed be able to meet more people or get to know get to know about Texas more or less yeah umhum well not yeah exactly you know get get to i still have a hard time uh laughterunderstanding laughtersome laughterpeoples accent oh yeah you know i i cant i i just cant understand what theyre saying laughter yeah some of them have some strong ones yeah there are yeah ive only been here thirteen years so okay where are you originally from Los Angeles Los Angeles boy theres a change i suppose its not as cold there as it is here now no now i wish i was back so its hot well whats life in LA like not good thats why im here laughter uhhuh a lot of crime and oh very high seems to me you know i i couldnt understand why it would be such a heavily populated area if theres so much crime so much smog so much traffic because you cant people cant leave you cant just up and leave and not know where youre going i left because i was in the service so i didnt have you know i had a lot to i could leave laughter ,credit_card,3370
 well i dont know what to do about the federal budget um there certainly been ideas surfaced uh recently um matter of fact repeatedly by many people and i sort of wonder what your what thoughts you had on that area what the uh the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when when were talking in trillions of dollars uh  which is an astronomical sum and and the people that are talking these numbers  have no concept of what that number means now are you are you talking about the elected people or are you talking about others umhum the elected people yes umhum our our our Senate and Congress and and people that that deal everyday and and whats going to be done with those monies um and dont really understand what that is or how a budget even works uh we need to elect people that are more uh  or im not sure how you would achieve how would you achieve that i mean if  well  lets lets make them have a degree in economy uh or economics  uh so you would trust the decision making vocalizednoise economists you you sometimes called the dismal science laughteryeah but but people people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar um  when in in in the the uh lobbyists needs to be eliminated uh from Congress um they dont make pragmatic decisions they make a decision based on constituency constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe um you know the the  or or they tack on these uh pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country right so so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists i mean right now lobbyists require to register youd just say oh i definitely i definitely would yeah get rid of them love that make them all no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for totally uh i i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute contribute but they should not have a oneonone relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them that thats a conflict of interest as far as im concerned when youre talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars uh youre youre youre jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today and that so uh you talk about jeopardizing the future would you be against any deficit spending i i think to bring it in line youre going to have to have a generation thats going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you cant ease into it it took years and years to build up the momentum thats there now uh i i i forget the figures on the interest rate but its something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest part of the problem is we dont loan from ourselves we we buy from intimate international banking thats why we have interest and and i i really i really feel that that that is part of the problem that we weve let things get so out of control that that we dont wanna put the brakes on them but what what practical steps could one could one take um by by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable well but everybody will say that he is for that oh of course yeah uh and and and how will you make that actually happen and then add on to it you take the gross national income and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax across the board everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax sounds like a good idea nothing escapes right no no deductions nothing just ten percent thats right right no deductions you pay a ten percent income tax thats what you pay if you make forty million dollars uh then youre going to pay four million if if you make forty dollars youre going to pay four dollars and and thats it yep so that thats it thats i mean i i agree with that thats a good idea idea and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what and  i dont know that it  that it would or wouldnt ,budget,3387
so how many um credit cards do you have i think im down to one oh my gosh i wish i was that way is that why you said i had more experience than you well no i was pulling your leg laughter oh well how how do you use your credit card i mean do you just keep it in reserve or i i well the way id like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time and then you pay that off and dont use it until uh its paid off thats thats my ideal way how how do you laughteruse laughterit emergencies come along and i laughter and i use it yeah thats understandable exactly uh like uh my car uh had a major problem and seven hundred dollars and right right things just come up and you just never get to use it the way youd really like to umhum well actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you laughterhave um and i use them you know like my American Express i use for you know gas things like that and i pay that off monthly and then um some other credit cards like store credit cards you know i do have them up there a little bit but uh i try not to use them too often but living in this area and like i live fifteen miles west of Washington DC its a very expensive area laughter so sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something yeah well i i know i was uh up in there had a lot of credit cards and i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble so we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it uhhuh well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that i just umhum now are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card or well i just yeah yeah well now we pretty much just pay cash for uhhuh hm as much as we can there uh uhhuh our our only credit card is Sears so uhhuh hm and i have that for automotive purposes right well well thats great um everyone i know here uses um credit cards like theyre going out of laughterbusiness to be honest with you hm yeah yeah its its just too easy basically uh just get yourself in trouble with those yeah yeah yeah the only other one i have i have like a Diners Club through my um where i work i see so that i use uh because i travel some so i use that and i dont really have to worry about that because i only use it for business so i automatically have the money to pay it off but hm uh i wouldnt mind uh you know getting back into one if they would you know you start out at a low limit and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit and and if i can get one thatll keep my limit at five hundred and i can never go over that or something like that then thats fine but they eventually gets up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand laughter forget it i dont want that laughter um laughter the temptations too great i dont know just uh writing checks is just as easy i guess yeah thats true thats true so i guess uh weve kind of exhausted this uh laughtertopic yeah well really what what can you yeah you cant say too much about it really other than you use them or you dont use them you like them or you dont like them so i guess uh they dont care care if we end it early so hopefully uh you have a good Thanksgiving thats coming up and okay you too and then uh maybe well talk again yeah maybe youre the furthest person actually that ive talked ive talked to a lot of people in Texas Texas is the big one yeah so laughterokay then well bye now okay byebye ,credit_card,3409
uh well i i kind of feel like we pay um um maybe uh little uh too much actually i mean like twenty five thirty percent of our income the average family you know vocalizednoise uhhuh yes absolutely and it just seems uh um and yet you have big corporations that that manage uh just because the way the laws are written not to pay anything at all year after year after year uhhuh yeah no i i agree with you there um ive gone to other states where theres no food tax you know some things there arent taxed at all and i think that thats really nice i think they thats what Texas needed to do also is to discriminate as to uh which should be taxed and what shouldnt be taxed so uhhuh i dont ive never been any place that didnt have it we went from here to North Carolina for a while and and they had a food tax there so i guess im just kind of oh see we dont they dont tax food here do they no they do they do uhhuh yeah but i have lived in other states in which they dont uh tax uh food uh clothing items personal things like that they do tax and um so that was that was really neat but i guess the way that they get around it though is that theres no quote state income tax but then you pay laughter ten fifteen percent taxes um you know i know they say its only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh but yeah i really think that its its way too much no state income tax right uh whenever you buy an item especially a large purchase item it its its something in which youre youre paying and youve always got to add in that about ten percent tax laughter uh what do you feel about do you feel like um how do you feel about for what we get back in the way of services and things in the last what in in the way of services for for the money that we pay oh in the money that we pay um well  now for the city of Plano um i really like the the things that they offer here yeah i do too um i and i cant say that for for all of Dallas or all of Texas um but for Plano i do i really think that i get my my moneys worth they always seem to be ahead of any other um city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping Plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too so yeah yeah well we participate in a lot of the recreational you know we use the recreational facilities umhum umhum and uh  where we came from in North Carolina i mean it was a nice area but we didnt have any the mean the the recreational recreational facilities they have here are just unbelievable so i think that we get a good deal in the way that goes  right umhum umhum well and i think you get spoiled and you expect it whenever you go to any place else and its just not quite up to standard or par and its just like oh gee whiz you know it makes you really appreciate i think uh you know that your city and uh what it has to offer now as for the state you know i uh uh you know i guess the the highways outside of what metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay laughter i dont know i havent i havent been much i havent been much outside well yeah i used to travel when i was here and they seem to be okay yeah and the outside i mean the your state highways i i think you know are are pretty adequate uh adequate but gosh you get into the cities laughterand laughteryou might as well forget it um yeah yeah now we lived in Houston for a while in the vocalizednoise and in in the city was pretty pretty pretty rough in places right yeah so um i i dont know im uh im really glad that they didnt go to the um the the state income tax um im hoping the lottery is going to uh take care of it uh i know theres a lot of religious issues and et cetera um but i im hoping that uh in a way people can can see that as a contribution then to the state um i did live in Ohio for a couple of years and i know thats how they kind of got around um you know having to uh taxes or increase in taxes was was by the lottery is that right yeah yeah yeah and and i know the people are concerned that its only gonna be the the lower you know income people who are actually going to you know be the the biggest participants in this um yeah so some of those folks probably say youre taxing them anyway then if youre dangling a lottery out there in front of them yeah yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and um i only saw it as being you know really positive and of course it you know was just a fluke if you won you know because i really never expected to win and and i never did the big big lottery were talking about uh but you know every once in a while id come up with two or three dollars or something but i felt good in the sense that i was really putting my money the way i felt it was back into uh the taxes uh and it went actually most of it went to the schools and uh to school reforms things like this so uh yeah i i saw it really as a positive thing yeah how do you feel about um federal services and things laughter you you know i was yeah what are what are the federal services what what do we i mean i know we got a big army and and you know uh i guess i guess they have matching federal funds for a lot of our state and local projects right well because i was looking at some of the services that i actually use now i did um uh way back when i did use government um things such as uh uh food stamp ,taxes,3413
 um i guess my  initial view is our tax burden hasnt gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in in the world and in part of the matter you get what you pay for were gonna have national health insurance which seems likely its necessarily gonna involve more taxes uh i suspect they take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh  energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes thats the direction we should look right well i guess i kind of have mixed feelings laughter um you know you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it and you wonder you know wheres it all going and we have such a huge uh national deficit and where its all going and i guess a lot of times theres questions wondering well if its doing a whole lot of good i know theres a lot of social programs out there that need help but you kind of always wonder well where wheres the money going laughter well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into into a big trust fund but that is a particularly regressive tax uh its a tax on the first dollar earnings and Senator Moynihans uh proposal to to to cut there i think would makes a lot of sense im sorry i couldnt i couldnt hear that i think Senator Moynihans proposal to to cut the social security tax which isnt really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense right right yeah i agree with that  as far as other countries im not um i dont keep up on it too much just as laughterfar as what you know as what theyre doing i know we were in Ireland last year and i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here but oh yes but as far as other countries im not uh up to par on laughter i think Japan i think Japan is probably about equal to ours and other major countries are higher i had friends were amazed at the sales taxes the classes of things when they went to Canada vocalizednoise not so long ago and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services and its a real real theyre theyre real tradeoffs there yeah but and and you sit there and wonder um i guess this doesnt really have to do with taxes but just money in general and and um wondering if youre gonna have enough when you retire laughter to live on uh i that thats a scary thing with this no no real knowing about uh the the theres a lot of inflation risk that isnt taken care of in most private pension plans yeah thats true but um are you involved with the legislature up there or since  no im at the National Institute of Standards and Technology uh theyre part of the Commerce Department here in vocalizednoise here in in Gaithersburg Maryland uhhuh i was just wondering since you said Washington DC and you and you picked this topic i was laughterjust kind of curious  well well i i i didnt pick it uh oh you didnt i um i like i dont really recall what i may have filled out on the on the form but i i certainly think certainly been given topics different from the ones that id mentioned before oh did you see i havent placed any calls did they automatically assign the topic yes yes when you place a call topic is given to you oh i didnt know that i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic because i havent made any calls yet ive just received some oh you should try it oh i didnt realize that laughter okay laughter yeah because its kind of a it can be a rather controversial subject depending on who youre talking to laughter uh many of the subjects are uh and taxes taxes especially um one thing that has kept kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the is the level of defense of the defense budget and thats that same subject ,taxes,3417

well what do you uh  how do you feel about your uh job benefits well im a contract person and uh so i dont have a lot of benefits and uh uh i do think theyre very important my husband has medical insurance and he has a life insurance policy his company does not really have a retirement plan and i think thats something thats very important and uh i believe medical insurance and retirement are probably the two strongest yeah well i um  i worked for a  two most important a large oil company for ten years and then resigned in eighty four and went into business for myself uh and what i discovered at one after i had resigned it was kind of amazing i had never really thought about that corporate umbrella yes laughter right while while it was there and after i resigned and i walked out from under it i really felt exposed and it was something that i had been completely you know you grow accustomed to having that behind you or or or over you yeah you sort of take it for granted absolutely and it was ill ill tell you i was absolutely amazed at how at at the difference and then laughter plus whenever i had to start paying for my own health insurance oh i know isnt that a shock and and life insurance  believe me it was it was a rude awakening  so anyway i was in business for myself for six years and then i have gone back to work uh since uh nineteen ninety im back in Houston with another oil company so im back under that corporate umbrella and i will tell you i am glad to have the laughtercoverage laughteragain  laughter well we uh kind of discovered it when uh the company my husband was with uh was in real estate and he had some nice benefits with it and all of a sudden when the market dropped out up here of course then you know everything kind of went downhill and then he went with a steel company and they they folded but he was still under the uh COBRA plan on the medical insurance and then all of a sudden the people that had taken it over went bankrupt well that ended COBRA plan plan and everything and uh then we discovered vocalizednoise and our medical insurance for three months was running us uh i think it was nineteen hundred dollars you know our age and uh i had some arthritis and stuff and man they socked it to us uhhuh  and you know course now fortunately we were back we have some medical insurance well i feel like im im the luckiest person in the world on in several ways number one i had the opportunity to get out whenever i left um   uh Houston in uh eighty four and resigned i had the opportunity to get out and do all those things that i thought would be so glamorous and exciting wording working for myself laughter yeah laughter and they were and they were for a while and then i found out that it was just as much work to do that as it is going into an office you know getting on a plane and flying around and all that kind of stuff  umhum umhum umhum what did you do consulting work well no actually i was uh my brother and i had a architectural design firm we did uh retail tenant finish out all over the US and it was oh uhhuh you know very successful and a lot of fun and more work than ive ever done in my life and at the same time i got all of that out of my system and it is so its so wonderful now and im so appreciative too of and and i know now i think so much better than some of my coworkers what it means to and have somebody thats providing laughter umhum laughter some of this stuff for you and uh you know im real lucky my company has good uh health benefits and dental benefits umhum and also uh retirement plan on a contributory thrift plan that im i was just thinking about that today i need to up my contribution to that if i can force myself to save a little bit more umhum well i know that my husband the company hes with now has excellent uh hospitalization and prescription card and dental insurance but they have no retirement uhhuh yeah benefits and you know we definitely you know miss this i grew up in a family that had their own business you cannot pay me enough money to go into business for myself and my laughterhusband has watched my family and i dont believe you could pay him enough yeah well i tell you until youve done it you dont know what its like you you its on your mind twenty four hours a day seven days a week and im i literally drove myself nearly insane i was at

okay go ahead and uh tell me what youre looking for in a job now one thing that i look for is um well maybe not the most most important thing but benefits like um health insurance for my family and another thing would be um reasonable reasonable work hours uh good working environment right now i think its were supposed to talk about uh our current situation im a post doctoral fellow and a a what a post doctoral  fellow um i im its for the training beyond your doctorate degree i get the same benefits as the vocalizednoise staff at the university i work at the University of Iowa i i like i like working at the University one of the benefits there is you get  a lot of flexibility in when you work and when you wanna take time off for example this Christmas i have about three weeks that i get to go out west to visit my family and so thats pretty good you it would probably be hard to have something like that in another type of job so you like having having the flexibility to be able to take off time when you want to thats important to you oh yeah besides just some besides some semester breaks the there is also other um  other times too um  like during the summer and things like that does uh recognition from others and a sense of contributing to the organizations success does that rank pretty high for you oh yes and thats one of the reasons laughteri laughterlike the University too because you do get credit for your own work um  my advisor my mentor here especially especially he used to work in industry but he couldnt stand it because um  he felt like that his boss at uh at this aerospace place space company where he worked uh his supervisor got credit for all the um achievements that he made so thats why he came back to the University yeah thats thats kind of a rip when you feel that way so i think at the University you get often get credit for more you know your name gets on what you do like when you publish articles and things like that hey David whats your doctorate in um  its in physics however um  you know there is several several branches within physics i i studied sound acoustics and the subject for that is called acoustics and im specifically interested in the acoustics of speech im working now at the National National Center for Voice and Speech thats located here at the University of Iowa so youre kind of interested in this thing that vocalizednoise were participating in then oh i found out about it because i attended um  a conference for the Acoustical Society of America in Texas and uh  the chairman of the session where i presented a paper um um was it Mister Godfrey laughterhe laughterum was uh  he he he gave me a a thing and said to try and find others to help join for this project hm and so youre enjoying all the benefits that a professor would at the moment is there oh i couldnt say that well i meant as health and uh i i dont get a the salary for one thing oh yeah nor the job stability post a post post doctoral fellow is only for two years but the ultimate goal usually of a post doctoral fellowship is probably to go on and accept a position at a University so this is um  you know the economy with the Gulf War and everything um last year around the time i was graduating um there was just were not very many opportunities available so this was the best thing because um my post doctoral fellowship like this um um is a good thing on your resume for when you apply to be a professor or something like that okay uh David is one of the things that i i suppose so you dont want to be out in the weather and uh the environment like construction workers for you its better to be inside airconditioned warm warm uh yeah especially uh with the humidity here in Iowa yes i i i would uh definitely want a indoors job um  do you have a um i work as a EDP auditor yeah yeah and ive got a degree and a bunch of different certifications that go along with  ,job_benefits,3502
you think youre getting your moneys worth uh never laughter laughter i laughter uh the only thing im im thankful of is that we dont have to pay any income tax here in in Texas well thats probably the next years agenda yeah boy i tell you what i sure hope they dont pass something like that oh yeah theyre finding the way the tax you every time you turn around and i i think one way or the other were gonna pay for the bureaucracy i guess and uh its one area thats uh really i i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and i i i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now well i i tell you um i remember every time it seems like we turned around theyre adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline  thats right thats right and  actually that one the the the taxes on gasoline dont dont bug me as much as uh uh what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax  yep thats right and every time you go to buy anything now uh even though you know they they tax food thats the one that really kind of bothers me well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is its an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which allegedly allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards but uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they arent going to be paying taxes on you know and uh thats the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but i dont think it is anymore not in Texas anyway oh i got you because people that uh dont make very much money wind up spending it all thats right thats right and whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on thats right thats right and thats the unfairness of the thing but uh i think taxes laughtergenerally laughterare laughterunfair laughter  what what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten thousand or thirty thousand dollars well you know like other things if they dont affect you you dont worry about them too much laughter laughteri i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so uh it doesnt i i think uh uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know and uh oh sure i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh thats their prerogative you know laughter i i i dont have a whole lot of laughtersympathy laughteron laughterthat you you maybe you buy that you know and i dont mean to be knocking uh no uh no i havent but it it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax uh on top of it and theres an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know well it its just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know its a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards now i dont know if thats true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know any any kind of interest that youre paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchases so thats a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they dont you know to a degree  well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you laughterknow laughterthey laughterquit laughterbuying laughteranything laughter laughter well what what about the taxes on cigarettes ,taxes,3541
 and all right well i mean short term i dont think anythings gonna be done about it well i or probably should be done about it uh are you saying you didnt think anything should be done in the short term uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention yeah well i i think that youre absolutely right there the other thing is is that weve got these um these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh and that effectively adds to it whether its officially on the books or not right exactly and thats got to be paid exactly and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem thats going to continue to be with us for a while to come um im not really uh sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if theyre talking about reducing uh the tax that needs to be paid or the taxes taxes currently being paid then that cant it seems to me it cant possibly vocalizednoise you know help with the the deficit picture it can only hurt the deficit picture yeah exactly and the the severity of the deficit picture already the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term yeah exactly so that that thats the current predicament yeah it seems seems like its its a kind of a catch twenty two i mean its its the um my understanding is what theyre trying to what what supposedly theyre trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes theyll have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue but it it seems like like uh its sort of a uh a spiral an unending spiral and it it uh im im not sure that theres any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are are being recommended by by the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend and uh yeah im not sure how i feel about tagging them to share the cost of yeah the the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point its partly a judgment of how bad the recession is yeah it uh it would seem to me that that there are other things that the administration could do well look first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates umhum i think thats been a positive development i think what thats done is its its its helped keep inflation from um uh well at the moment were doing very well on inflation yeah exactly and its a sort of a piece of luck thats the sort of upside to the deficit thats thats the upside to the recession yeah um  i dont know what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term  and the longer well can be done or will be done are two different things um at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah they shouldve put a in the Reagan administrations took took took vocalizednoise layoff such entitlements to the to the poor but left them for the middle class ah in the longer term ah we we wed do well i think to make to make uh reductions there also somewhat related vocalizednoise is to collect money thats owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed right i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second situation and i think certain entitlements i im inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where i think that we would be foolish to um uh a lot of the education aid has gone to so called trade schools which are so there not colleges but schools that teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition oh i see what youre i see what youre saying ah and the school gets paid off immediately ah they dont provide very much education and uh and then the and then the people default on the loans well i i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh and i i i cant confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but but but taking what youre saying at face value then i would have to agree with you completely ,budget,3561

 well my view i work for a financial institution and oh boy laughter yeah and i love my credit card uh you end up with more consumer rights by using credit cards than what do you mean by that uh what i mean is say you pay for something with a check your check clears youre out the bucks you pay for something with a credit card you dissatisfied are dissatisfied with it you take it back and they say sorry we you cant take it back if you know you can leave it there and then just have your Visa charged back oh whats your favorite credit card do you use Visa how come  get your money back well thats the kind we offer laughter oh thats a good reason thats a good reason and uh were just offering a a new card that gives you one up to one percent back of all the charges that you make cash back you know like Discovers i was gonna say i know Discover does that yep and were starting to do that Visas gonna do it too we are who all right who puts out your Visa card uh we do  America First Credit Union who is we America First Credit Union and youre gonna offer the cash back just like Discover does huh well i ill tell you that works because i use my Discover card more than any other credit card for that sole reason did you get much back hm  yeah laughter unfortunately i use my Discover card more than i ought to not a great deal i get i get about a check for about fifty some bucks at the end of the year usually well good for you that must mean and its one percent so you spend about five thousand laughter i shouldnt tell that to laughteryou thats pretty good well i i do better than that everything goes on mine and then ive got a business too that i use it for charging computers on well i tell you then then i have an exact account of everything ive bought its all printed out it is nice and as long as you keep your statements then you know exactly what youve spent and if you know when you bought something because often i wont remember and i can go back you know ill remember the month so i can go back to my my credit card invoice and there it is it tells me the exact date and everything well how many cards have you got well i have a whole slew of the them but i really i use i have a Visa um but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my uhhuh a debit card yes i dont like those yeah and so i dont either because its gone although they dont debit it until the end of the month yeah oh really thats interesting um but it still automatically comes off that month if i time it right then any like  my my date is the twelfth so if i charge something on the thirteenth then i dont get that bill till the end of the month and its not due till before the twelfth of the next month so i can put off paying for something for free for two months with a debit card no not with a debit card with my Discover card i can and and i use Discover more than any other because of the cash back oh credit oh okay i have MasterCard and then i have all the different department stores but i just really never use them and i try desperately hard to pay it off each month  yes because the the cost to use it is terrific is it twenty percent interest uh it varies from eighteen and a half to twenty one percent wow  and thats thats tremendous amount our cards thirteen and a half oh youre kidding me uh with a ten dollar annual fee how do you get one of yours well you have to be a member of our credit union and what credit union is that America First its were the vocalizednoise oh but see youre in Utah yeah yeah and youd have to be a resident of the state oh okay i was thinking about your brother laughterhe laughtersaid Jack and hell do that but thats youre nowhere near us wow  thats a neat idea though perhaps some other people around here will catch on and do it too uh do you have Mervyns and all those have you noticed that they all have started issuing their own credit cards oh yeah oh yeah they have for years but you can still use the three big ones MasterCard Visa and now Discover you can still use those three um at almost any department store what do you think of Discover uh Sears not taking anyone but theirs they have not done that for years yeah do you like that or do you think thats fair or laughter i dont know i used when i was a a kid laughter i worked for Sears and it im just  im so used to them not taking anybody but theirs theyll take Discover but see they back Discover too so it doesnt bother me because i use Discover most of the time yeah yeah its theirs ah okay lets see do you think that uh the move towards plastic is a good thing  i think i ,credit_card,3589
what i like in a good job is i like good salary but also i think they should have insurance benefits and profit sharing and retirement funds like that so that you can plan for the future and they dont do that any more like they used to in the big companies well i i i can agree with what you say and of course uh in addition to what you mentioned uh you know id like to see them have some uh have more companies have like dental care yes uhhuh and uh medical and dental yeah and more benefits for uh working mothers uh uh thats right i noticed here lately theres some companies have been providing what they kind of call an inhouse day care center where the mothers can come and leave their uh children with somebody locally at the company and go to work and if something happens theyre immediately there thats great oh wouldnt that be great yeah i have a couple of teenagers i have a couple of daughters uh one of which is married and has two two small sons and and they stay in a day care and and they have a lot of sickness because theyre around the other children yeah yeah and it would be so nice if uh the company she worked for provided that uh you know in house or or nearby or thats right now there is there is one benefit that uh is uh offered now um where they pay they pay they pay for hospitalization uh with funds uh before income tax funds uh before with funds that are not taxed and but i think thats more or less kind of in the group insurance field so thats a new innovation too for a benefit well that inhouse day care is excellent they could go on their lunch hour and see their kids or any time yeah thats true and uh lets see what other benefits do you have any others uh that youd like to see how about uh well i the profit sharing and the retirement they just dont offer those like they used to yeah in the old days of course they didnt have any any benefits at all they preached job security but that that went out fast oh it didnt thats right and uh so now days i guess funding takes part or rather uh uh your benefits are locked in after youre there with a company for five years but the benefits are so small and usually theyre tied in with social security and uh it vocalizednoise most people retire on social security now thats all they have right and uh so uh even if you have benefits and you and then when you get to social security age theyre not as great because theyre tied in to social security benefits so you dont get both of them in full so its hard today to live off of social security if you dont have your home paid for thats right thats right so uh thats what my folks did theyre just living on social security  they had  two houses and they were trying to buy sell one to pay off the other one and oh they waited for like four or five years trying to vocalizednoise sell that one house so they could pay off the other one because theyre just living on social security they had a real hard time i see yeah you got to have your house paid for well you know uh benefits uh are great and uh the more that a company can provide the better off we are but its so hard now for companies to make a profit as you no doubt uh know you know most of our companies uh are losing their shirt thats right thats right going bankrupt and uh so some kind of system has to be devised were more vocalizednoise more competitive perhaps weve uh uh been uh we were too used to off time and all these benefits that are not uh taking care of us in our old age but were getting immediate effect of them like for example like seven hour days and and uh when in effect while were young we ought to be working harder and come up with better benefits so that when we get older we have the uh we we have those benefits available to us in in a need that would make it easy for us in retirement yeah they dont have to work so hard uh you know social security again most of the young people today are paying in they they dont they dont have any any they dont believe that anything will be left over umhum umhum when they get to retirement age course the old bank never gets out you know i heard that all my life there wasnt going to be any when i was on it uhhuh and uh so uh or when i got on it i guess uh we can make our dollar go lower and lower and lower until you get to zero and then everybody can say okay nobody has anything and start over again well the insurance thats thats the main thing that i worry about is the insurance insurance costs are going up well and they and they just vocalizednoise ,job_benefits,3601
 hey this is Bryan how you doing  this Jay in Dallas how are you im fine thanks nice to meet you  good where are you from im from right right now im living in Utah but my familys in Plano and thats where im at right now oh okay yeah so calling pretty close at home right laughternow well you ready to give this topic a a whiz that be great all right here we go  all right would you like to go first or go ahead all right um im pretty young so i dont have a whole lot of credit cards i when i first got one i made a big mistake and got pretty far into debt and ever since then ive decided that its if im gonna make a purchase i i make it and have the check written out at within the next week for the purchase i made and that way i i keep my credit cards at an even balance yeah thats right i i think thats what happened to everybody out there gets back when they just sent them to you without any ive got i dont know how many tons of them but uh i use uh well this one particular one for everything i mean everything i buy including groceries and it runs up pretty high every month but i then i pay it off because i get a a air uh advantage miles on American with it so i i can get a you know ive already gotten a free trip just from using that card so i dont uh i dont have any carry over balances any more but i just i was wiped out there for years but that was the way to do stuff and uh you i think you have to make the decision but um Texas is uh you know its a debtor state and if you get in too big of a trap you you can just blow them off and thats not good but i know lot of people do it its what runs that interest rate up you know pretty high yeah right umhum and i agree you know i think theres a lot of benefits for example i know that my sister and brotherinlaw as well as my parents they they use them quite like you do you know they just theyre within every month theyre within five dollars knowing within five dollars of what it is and and then they right it off but to that advantage it gets you know the privileges of like you said like the the mileage and the well its uh the interest rates are still crazy up there you know i i i mean theyve come down every  except the credit cards so its not uh its not really an advantage to have them now theyre uh some of mine are up i think up over twenty percent i dont use them anymore but i think think theyve gone over twenty percent a year youre kidding and some of them you know i think the one im using is about fifteen but i dont use the interest anymore so it doesnt make a difference and then when i travel i travel a lot in Europe i use Diners Club and that gets all  my um uh insurance on rental cars and  and plus they have a pretty good uh uh plan on the gifts and things like that i try to get something out of them now uhhuh laughter so laughter well thats right you know i i think too one of the things that ive become very aware of in terms of when im looking for a credit card is im looking i look for something that doesnt have an annual fee right absolutely theres no use paying that fifty or whatever it is a month a a year absolutely i just you know i think that if youre doing that youre pretty stupid because you could be using that on something that you really want oh sure um personally the not my next project i think is to take those that i do have uh listed and cut them up that im not using uh especially the ones that dont i that theres a working asset to these that gives a lot of uh money to um  the environment and things like that thats my second here but ive got one Cigna Visa that doesnt give you a damn thing so uh i think ill cut it up this year for my New Years resolution yeah and i think i agree with you too you know im im should have a Visa i havent this is my first year ive had a Visa and i think im gonna cut up everything that im not using its just stupid to have them around and yeah ive got a lot of um gasoline credit cards that i dont use anymore because they take all the others so i might as well pitch them i mean its just weight carrying it in your pocket yeah and i agree and i think the one the one thing that ive really learned too is that if youre gonna have a credit card just you know if youre not gonna use it for example like you said a with a Visa card really you can almost do anything now and id just as soon have it all on one card so i know exactly where its my bills are gonna come from and absolutely yeah i think a lot of times especially like im a student so i dont have a really big income but i have to you know be really careful not to over extend myself and when im using it on other cards it oh yeah you can i was absolutely um IRS checked me one time and they said nobody in the world could have paid this much interest and i said laughterwell im glad you mentioned that because ive got receipts for all that but you know something else i couldnt have proven but uh that was uh im not young anymore so i uh took a long time to learn but a lot of young people do get trapped on it its easy you know you dont have any money and yep and i think its uh i think you know i was really lucky in that this summer when when i did it i i had enough and i was working enough that i could basically pay it all off within you know six months or so so it wasnt where i was over my head but i i got enough of a taste of it to realize what i didnt wanna do anymore oh sure and they got all those late charges now and stuff they didnt used to have and if you go over the limit theres a charge i mean theyre theyre really starting to hit us oh laughteryeah you know a lot harder than they used to theyve theyve ,credit_card,3623
 start first sure i guess laughter im trying to think do we pay too much taxes uh uh well i it it certainly seems like it i dont know you know i i im not up in the uh in in the high end brackets myself and so i can just imagine how bad that would hurt i remember at one point when my dad was paying uh nearly nearly sixty percent tax tax bracket and that was just you know it was killing him laughter yeah and i think thats thats basically my standpoint too is my dad and ive talked about this a lot and i just personally i think its kind of i dont know we pay a lot um sometimes i I know that its not used very wisely and i think the big thing for me and what my dad has said is we pay a lot but its worth it to live in America i guess for our freedom yeah uh i mean other places pay more and you know so you can look at some place like Sweden and you know they they almost all give like seventy percent of their income to the government um they get some different things out of it though uh i dont know i im not im not terribly pleased with the distribution of of of it and i think we we spend entirely too much on defense um although i work in in sort of hi tech industry type thing and and and which in large part survives on on uh on defense contracting you know so so i mean i kind of biting the hand that feeds you if you really wanna sorry cutting it hard but um i dont know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit uh things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i i i and i think that we could get by without continually raising taxes you know i mean i think i think were at a point where you know its its taxes are a burden but their you know um services come out of it and and things are important but on the other hand you know they just cant continue to rise forever and the deficit cant continue to grow you know theres theres got to be some point where people sit down and say okay you know this is enough income to give government services at and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point and you know and and the sad thing i think personally you know i dont mind paying so much taxes if im getting whats due but i think a lot of times what happens is you get into the government system and my dad works for the government in some ways and he works a lot with people who are paid by the government and there are so many things to quote unquote protect the employee that you know youre youre youre not getting what youre paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation itd be see you you know right right you know there there there isnt there isnt the business cycle where where where government gets uh gets chopped down you know i mean and they they dont go through a restructuring you you know even IBM going through a cutbacks right and and you know government just doesnt do it you know and and and and its because of in part you know necessary protections for the worker but but on the other hand theres you know you you youve got to plan them in the real world also you know yeah and you got to walk that fine line i think one of the things that the government really could could save a lot of money on is is you know when its for example in defense spending when its something that you can use like an ashtray you know just go buy it at a store my gosh and laughter or buy it from a manufacturer instead of having it made and have to form the mold and everything you know yeah yeah and granted theres other things for example that you know a microwave or something if youre underwater youd have to have some specific specifications but but just to work out with our tax money you know watch where is it going to be best used and how is it going to be most effective cost wise right yeah i mean i think i think you you know in general im im pretty pleased with the government with you know with America and and a lot of the things that work here i mean oh yeah it there theres lots of things that dont quite work right and um but if youve ever spent any time in other countries you realize that that its all a relative issue issue you know everywhere everywhere things dont work right and some places they really dont work right and here they they laughterpretty much work right you know um but i think you know i mean if if things are gonna things that need to change are things that that need to be sort of restructuring you know maybe market orientation a little bit more and and things like what youre talking about um you know putting a little bit more of the pressures of the of the business pressures that are normal that are on everybody else on the government and uh so that we get a little bit more out of the tax dollars and a little bit and i agree with you there i think you know there theres nothing in my opinion from what ive seen and the people ive worked with some other countries and from our own country that that would ever take the place of the freedoms and the the the things that we have here for me i you know i i guess when it comes right down to it if it was living in a place like Mexico or Russia that are really struggling both with the government and with economics i would prefer to pay my extra tax money here and and have things the way they are yeah i i think my my wifes from Brazil and ive spent a fair amount of time there and and you wanna see a government system that just doesnt work you know i mean its just its incredible its just entirely corrupt they have uh you know something like uh seventy five percent or sixty five percent of the able bodied workers are employed by the government you know and so that leaves everybody else you know this other small ,taxes,3670
 you keep a budget um yes i do okay how how do you work that well usually it works out pretty well does it um i try to project out um right now i project out six months you know i have my fixed monthly bills and i know how much they are right  uhhuh and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to take off the top not unless i have something come up thats unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings well that seems to work out pretty good kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check and then i retain ten percent and if i dont use it then it goes into savings also for savings oh is it is it hard to set it up for the six month period rather than just a month or well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due so in fact so you budget all that in thats why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months ill have insurance it might two or three times a year and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point oh so really when youre doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for the six month period rather than just a month at a time oh umhum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of whats going on in your life because it doesnt give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for oh right and then also i mean thats if you do it monthly thats twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that yeah i do it uh twice a year and um you know i could adjust it every month thats no big deal uhhuh uhhuh but uh i just finished out December and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had January through July made out so you do it January to July and then July to December oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off umhum yeah i take the savings right off the top i pay myself first im the type of individual that uh you know i cant i have to put something back for myself to feel like im doing my job right right its my motivator and how much at what percentage do you save i save about fifteen percent oh thats great out of what out of my savings account not as well as the Japanese do laughter well that thats fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month twice a month uh uh actually every other week so twenty six checks every two weeks during the year oh thats great we so twice a year i pick up an extra check also oh thats right so that helps out gives you a bit there oh how do you all do yours well we we dont really do very laughterwell we have never sat down and made out a formal budget we keep saying you know were going to do this were going to do this we we take our savings right out vocalizednoise right out first and put you know put it away and then we just uh were thats terrible but we just kind of spend what we laughterneed thats right thats right we take the savings out and uh you know put that in and then spend whats left over huh spend what whats left over like you said and i know we if we keep but we just dont know how to get down and get started i guess trying to decide how much goes where and you know theres really no certain formula that you can say well i i wanna say this much and im gonna spend this much for the house and uh im kind of in a situation right now that my our children are grown and theyre gone so uh you know and the house is almost paid for so were in pretty good shape oh thats great now how did you get started when you started doing have you always done a budget or what uh weve done them for about fifteen years about fifteen years oh so quite a while huh did you just sit down and decide this much is this much is gonna go here and the thing we have a hard time with was you know like how much for the groceries and how much for the clothes and how much for one thing we do about the groceries and when and we just got back from the grocery store and weve been doing this for a long time and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery store because when we come home we write it down so in a given month we know that we spent two hundred and fifty dollars or four hundred dollars or whatever it is and if its four hundred dollars we look at it and say well why did we spend four hundred dollars and we spent four hundred dollars this month because or last month because uh we had several Christmas parties December right right so but we know approximately how much our our monthly grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within ten or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record if we just huh so and once you establish your track record so what ,family_finance,3673

now are we off and running that you were saying sorry oh i was just saying i guess old age has a few compensations i dont have to plan as carefully as i used to but uh do you feel like you you took the steps that you you were glad that you took um earlier i mean would you have done anything differently no i dont think so uh we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and um thats thats quite a feat in todays laughter laughter economic situation thats wonderful um im sort of beginning in that score um we have a two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon so its its not easy putting enough aside but were doing a um our best to try and have fairly regular meetings to discuss at least where our goals are sometimes um it is less consistent than than it could be in terms of our ability to put money aside but um im im curious about the things that you did that that seemed to work best for you that youd pass on to somebody else laughter uh well as as advice the only way if if you spend all you take in every month youre uh living beyond your means thats right laughter and emergencies or what we could would consider an emergency uh always come up i i i dont care how how you how closely you think you figured and then planned something always comes up so uh when i i guess we started by necessity because we went to uh law school on my husbands GI Bill back in the days when uh the government paid uh the students tuition and and bought books up to a certain amount plus uh gave the veteran a stipend we started off with ninety dollars a month and then a little bit later got up to a hundred and five dollars a month so there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly stipend was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope deciding that it was better to go without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month umhum umhum and then uh later on  when we got out of school my husband got recalled into the Air Force when the Korean mess came up and uh so we had already established the envelope habit and uh and the envelope is your savings no no no this was our weekly budget oh okay but uh we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to buy cars and that sort of thing that we would have to save up beforehand uhhuh uhhuh so uh we uh uh began uh in nineteen fifty uh to pay cash for everything we bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three months so since then except for a house houses weve paid cash for everything and uh to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity to take care of special pricing uh our headquarters was transferred from South Carolina to Texas one time and because Texas gas was much much cheaper to cook with than electricity this one couple that we were transferred with uh bought a gas stove a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty some odd dollars we had uh in storage and used uh just a little teeny gas stove but after we got to Waco we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had uh was moving into a house with a built in oven had the very best stove that Sears made at the time with two ovens a grill in the middle on top clock all the fancy amenities uhhuh uhhuh and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars because we had the cash yes yeah and uh uh thats thats been the case for us with with uh cars and our preference recently has been used cars so its been nice to be able to negotiate when you have cash when youre buying a car well thats a thats a an important lesson do you feel like youve passed that along to your three kids given how different the economys been in their lives no unfortunately we have not except for one daughterinlaw and uh laughter rise up and call her blessed every day uh for some reason or other my husband didnt see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance he just felt he had to keep control control of the purse strings and uh when they went off to college they had never really budgeted and uh that that was a big mistake so even though you know your children are going to make mistakes uh i dont i dont know how to tell you ,family_finance,3677
do you do you have a lot of credit cards um no i have i have two actually well thats all i have too yeah i um one of them one of them i use one of them i dont uh one of them is like an American Airlines thing where you get free mileage oh yeah ive heard about those yeah its pretty good i use that and i got im close to a free plane ticket anywhere in the United States oh thats nice and and the other one is uh um a credit card i got it was a while ago i got it like a free gold card and its good if i ever rent a car it pays for uh it pays for the insurance oh really so i keep that i never use that one but i happen to be going on vacation soon and im going to be renting a car so ill put it on that card and then if i got an accident they would pay for the insurance yeah they would pay for the accident yeah i only have two one of mines a gas card that i use just for my gas to and from work and the other ones a Visa for emergencies only like if i go on trips and stuff i take it with me in case my car breaks down or something but other than that i keep it locked up laughter yeah i never i never uh like i always pay you know like sometimes i use it out of convenience but i dont i dont run like on a a monthly balance you know i always pay whatever it is that that month yeah i just i make it a habit not even to carry my Visa because ive seen too many of my friends get in deep financial trouble with it yeah well laughteryou laughtercant it sometimes it easy i live in in in New York City and uh if youre going to go out and buy something for a hundred two hundred dollars not that its such a dangerous place but you know i just sometimes i dont feel that comfortable carrying a lot of money around so its good to have a credit card to pay for it with that um i use it for that where you live in LA no thank heavens i live in National City which is almost as bad where is that National City its outside of San Diego oh okay okay and unfortunately theres a lot of gangs around here so its like i dont carry money and i dont carry credit cards uh yeah its probably a good idea but uh yeah but i i dont mind i i dont see what the big deal is with um i i i couldnt see spending more than i had to pay the bill with because eventually its going to catch up with you i know i dont see how people can do that either but i know a lot of my friends have gotten in trouble deep trouble with them and its like well whyd you guys do it oh well its so easy to use laughter and its like yeah its easy to use but you have to pay for it you know laughter didnt this dawn on you but sure sure i got my credit cards through a guarantee agency do you know what that is right uh no you give them you put so much money in an annuity and it guarantees your credit card like say if something happened to you they could still pay off the balance with whats in there thats cool and whatever your limit is you keep that much in your annuity fund and its worked pretty good for what ive had it for about five years now and you can take the annuity out the money out of the annuity if you want to but its just there like you know in case you died suddenly or something you know they wouldnt be stuck with the bill cool cool that thats so i like it that way yeah you know they get paid for if youre dead right you know laughter yeah at least they wont be coming after my husband you know saying hey your wifes charged so much money on this credit card we want the money laughter thats true but then again you dont have to deal with him if youre dead so no but  i dont know i wouldnt want to leave him and my kids in that kind of a situation thats true thats true but ill tell you what it comes in real handy when youve got kids laughter cause we went we went on a trip to Arizona we drove there and the car broke down and it was me and my husband and our two kids in that car and Arizona is really hot and its like you know if we didnt have that Visa we wouldve been stuck there in that heat for heaven knows how long yeah that was like yeah like like the first time i ever got a credit card was for that reason because i was in uh where the heck was i i forget where i was i know i was in Europe one time and they ran out of money but i couldnt get money on my credit card either oh i was up i was dating a woman upstate New York and i was up in uh upstate and i had been in college and i guess i took like a hundred two hundred dollars with me or whatever at that time time maybe fifty bucks was enough to live on for a week but i laughter i took some money with me and i ran out of money like at the end of the first weekend i was supposed to be there for a week and i needed to i called up my father and i said dad you know go to my bank account and withdraw a couple of hundred bucks or whatever it was and could you send it Western Union and it was a pain in the neck i had to like wait till Monday and you know wait till the office opened and it took time and everything became a pain so what i did was i uh so what i did right after that is i got myself a credit card in case it ever happened again i can always you know buy something on the credit card and and not have to worry about carrying cash around so that was about ten ten twelve years ago and ive always had one since and like you said for that reason its its easy you know if you need the cash i couldnt imagine ,credit_card,3689
 who uh does your family keep a budget at all or well i sort of i mean in my mind laughteri laughterdo i dont write anything down or anything like that  ah i just know what my bills are and how much i

laughterbudget yeah three extra days youd a yeah about it huh yeah weve uh weve been trying to save for a house weve been really trying to penny pinch and oh thats a good one i tell you it gets tough when you know we have ive tried to write something out on a computer and stuff but it seems like every week theres something that comes up and makes it about impossible to well thats what happens thats exactly what happens it car breaks down or somebody gets sick or laughter umhum umhum so just when you think you might get a little ahead thats right thats what happens so thats kind of hard but are you uh are you able to plan or save anything for the healthy future or laughterno i know it its a day to day thing no laughter no not at all not at all i i barely get laughterby yeah i know all thats we i have my wife and a daughter and its about impossible yeah its hard its real hard and uh it doesnt get much better laughtereither laughterthats laughterhow laughterit laughtergoes laughterbut i know but you know i just think that laughter well thats good to hear laughter youre marked and youre supposed to have x amount of dollars and thats the way its gonna laughterbe laughteryou laughterknow laughteri laughtermean thats just thats how it feels really because its its just some people are just laughter and theres nothing you can do about it huh have more money and some dont and thats it laughter so  uhhuh and and im lucky i have a very low mortgage payment because i i had my house for a long time and yeah it makes you wonder how they get it all i mean  oh do you i dont have a car payment and you know i i dont have a lot of things so im pretty lucky but i have to make come up with the money totally by myself so thats hard too you know just it yeah well thats whats amazed us is weve been trying to get into a house and i just i just with what we make a payment i mean its about double what we pay for rent i just cant see how people do it these days yeah how is housing there well its actually Utahs been lucky we havent been hit by the recession so housing prices have stayed up the only thing thats helping us is that the mortgage rates are going down but uh its still moving pretty brisk and i say weve been kind of lucky we havent been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has yeah yeah weve been able to stay out of you know that we havent lost many jobs or anything like that up around yeah well im lucky ill never lose yeah that nursing but you know it doesnt matter if i lose a job one place ill just go somewhere else so yeah ive often said if i had it to do all over again i think id laughtergo laughterinto laughtersomething like that i seems like theres always you look in the paper and theres a huge demand for nursing and stuff so oh oh yeah really and and they get a little picky in one place and i know where i am now theres a whole big new administration and theyre theyre scaring everybody to death but i dont work on staff i just work on call oh do you you just work on call huh and umhum and so i have a couple of agencies that i work for and i make much more money that way and i can be independent i dont have to go to all the meetings and get into the politics and i dont get the benefits but i think its more than worth it then i just pay for that so yeah its a great thing but its risky and most people dont wanna oh yeah definitely definitely sounds yeah but it sounds like youve been doing all right with it so do that yeah ive i feel like it you know and its much more interesting that way too you dont get burned out so much so yeah so do you have a family or yeah i have a twelve year old and so yeah i have to you know take care of laughterher laughterso yeah so we know weve got to cover certain things its not just me so umhum oh do you enough to keep you kind of busy laughter yeah yeah thats true yeah i uh thats what uh you know were trying to we well i mean weve got a long ways off before school starts my daughters just eighteen months but you know you think about it i had to struggle my whole time through college you know pay for my own and get an occasional grant here and there but i just dont know how you know they can ever do it in ten years fifteen years from now when i have to go and well i know what you mean it does look impossible you look around you and i dont know how young people buy houses today or anything i really dont know and and a small little you know two bedroom home with you know five hundred square feet is about sixty thousand it seems like and those are pretty hefty payments to oh thats terrible well thats in Utah like i say i think were were probably below the market for the most part were pretty lucky that way but oh yeah well its not too bad in this area really the thing is theres a lot of money and like im in Plano so its a little bit north of Dallas but hasnt it but theres so much money in this town and there are things that are three hundred and five hundred thousand and lots and lots of them but you can buy a nice three bedroom home for like eighty thousand oh thats not bad so it really isnt its low compared to the rest of the country you know and theres all kinds of ,family_finance,3705
uh what do you how do you feel about it well i dont know i would hate i would rather not have to have it all taken out but i kind of feel like its part of living in a free country laughter but it seems like they take quite a bit out uh im a tax lawyer laughter and uh i uh oh yeah but i agree with you i uh you probably know like i say youre a lot more knowledgeable about it than i am but do you do for corporations or mainly yeah corporations i work for a bank oh do you oh yeah and uh so what what do they think the corporation you work with well banks banks are regulated of course by the uh by the federal government anyway so we dont have the franchise taxes which are  are not federal taxes uh i dont know i i think they i dont hear anything at work about them laughterreally yeah well i tell you i i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do oh okay whats the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i dont want to say battles but do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the unfair unfair uh unfair playing field and whatnot and whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get weve had that too because of the failures though oh yeah and uh whether or not they should be assessed more and uh the the state has uh has uh is in the midst of a reform probably in that area its where theyre going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund or or higher assessment to yeah huh yeah its uh i dont know i want i think ive always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldnt be but it seems like more and more uh were getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not uh i dont know that it is fair i think that its you know the way banking is being uh compacted i work for at Nations Bank which has just merged with C and S Sovran oh yeah and uh you know i think i think a little competition is good but down here a lot we saw laughter we say them doing things they shouldnt be doing yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the twenty uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not were yeah real estate you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff and i dont know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed theres no doubt about it everybodys gone down i think the individual levels are fine uh i dont think theyre perceived as uh was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know uh we wouldnt reduce the deficit laughterby but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean weve talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or well thats what sales tax are yeah thats true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh theyre debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesnt stimulate the economy that much it just uh laughterboots everybodys feeling about stimulating the economy yeah thats more or less touchyfeely thing as opposed to yeah i just always heard that the poor would end end up taking the worst brunt of it because theyre you know their their income is less and yet theyre being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know ive heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that itll be maybe a different level of tax but seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldnt do much anyway i i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct yeah thats true you cant take away people that said there you go youve got one exception already and uh and uh it you know well if we didnt have this exception then well just add this one and it just gets it snowballs yeah thats true i i think it is in theory probably a good idea well uh are the taxes in in Texas are they are few state taxes very high or we dont have state income tax oh dont you oh thats sweet  but weve got an eight percent state sales tax oh that hurts yeah and uh you know course thats thats a regressive tax yeah it is and its you know uh uh its not on grocery ,taxes,3717

 do work in a large organization now um well i i work in a actually its sort of an odd situation right now but uh i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago but its its not really a large organization but uh nearly nearly five hundred people oh yeah thats pretty laughterbig yeah how about yourself are you i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um besides salary it seems that people if its a large enough place need to feel that their jobs an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh yeah yeah its its more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one ooh yeah i i think it its probably the thing is that its always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah right everyones so integral yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that its its generally important umhum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too um umhum what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know in a larger yeah when it when ive worked with a with i mean the the small things ive worked with really havent had any uh any consistent yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i ive had my own little business and then ive worked for small businesses really in health care uhhuh and yeah the the the only ones that ive had large uh uh i mean ive had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations uhhuh vacation and also i work for the university and that thats a is very large organization and uh and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits i you you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean its its its handy to have them i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um uhhuh uhhuh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without um typically lets see uh typically the myself i i was covered myself but my family wasnt you know i had to chip in to for them to be covered but it was pretty economical umhum umhum um especially relative to just buying your own health care package right that really gets prohibitive yeah and so you know so thats thats handy uh you know i think that it im amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean its something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary yes ive heard that too and laughter which is which is pretty amazing it is especially especially if you consider in some situations people might actually use laughterthat laughtermuch hopefully they budget for that and it doesnt get used up entirely but its its a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office thats elsewhere but he doesnt he didnt really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the laughtersecurity of an organizations benefits i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that it it actually its interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to its uh ten or fifteen thousand um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it right are the rest of the package is pretty good its vision and dental and you know all the full medical oh well umhum yeah thats good i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking you know ive seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i havent yet at our hospital weve kind of been waiting with baited breath were the only hospital that i know of that doesnt have uh a partial payment or i dont know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer oh uhhuh copayment uh uhhuh so as as of this date laughter my husband and my kids are free because theyre dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if yeah i i mean i vocalizednoise typically you typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i ive the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um you know they dont wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand theyre real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping ,job_benefits,3724
okay i guess we start talking about the budget very good sir okay you you live near the nations capital what can we do about this mess well uh living near the nations capital unfortunately doesnt do you any good uh all laughteri all i uh find that i can do is read the newspapers and try to decide whats best for us what we need to do and thats sort of a function of the economy and our relationship with uh other countries and so forth and right now were in this big change since Russia has undergone such a uh big uh renegotiation within themselves and im sure that we havent quite decided where we stand in that yet i see big opportunities in Europe opening up uh it just it just seems to me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a capitalistic society yes i think theyre looking for that they just need guidance yes that would be very good for us to help show them what it what it takes to have a a capitalistic society and one in which each of them has a a say and uh you know can express their thoughts safely  another thing i think the uh that the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things speeded up is help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them some tax credits i think theyve done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past im in my forties and i basically remember getting some sort of traxtax tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate oh i dont recall ever getting a rebate but it does seem as though if if we are able to reduce the our expenditures for defense course weve got to get get this big debt that the country has under control and if as we get that under control then id like to see the taxes that we pay reduced a certain amount you know so that were all comfortable but i do believe that the countrys gonna have to get itself straightened out debtwise before uh they could do too much that way but i hate to see them raise the taxes if its unnecessary well ive always believed in paying my fair share of of of taxes oh and whatever my government says is my fair share is what i think i should pay sure that makes sense uh i dont necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find loopholes and not paying their fair share vocalizednoise yes it it it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to pay your share and that really is sort of against what the whole ball games about isnt it yeah the lady who does my taxes for me every year it seems like shes got a new suggestion and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i dont uh since i no longer work uh usually its not very complicated anymore but uh you no longer work i no longer work uh  oh its been almost three years ago i had some uh strange heart problems occur oh my and uh so im more or less hang around the house and uh that sort of thing  well you have more experience at that than i i just retired from working myself on December thirty first so i havent really had time to look at it from the retiree point of view but itll be an interesting uh concept im sure yeah its uh i know for the i thought maybe i would go back to work especially during that first year and then they finally decided that then maybe ill never work again so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially and things like that i can no longer afford  things that maybe i used to take for granted yes that and i certainly cant invest money like i used to laughter i understand well its unfortunate you had that problem and i do hope you will be able to work out your circumstances so that you can live comfortably and feel confident that you are doing your share of the taxes and you know still there are certain things that you need to do in your family and yourself to enjoy life to its fullest what kind of work did you do when you were working i was working uh in doing research for the government so i know what its like i had worked for the government basically im actually im a professor a retired professor at Penn State oh yeah and uh but my work has always been in research uh related uh to the government so im im aware of what it takes to perform the work thats needed the government has got to decide what it needs to know and then set up the criteria by which problems are solved and and uh the ,budget,3739
 are you Bob i am in Plano where are you oh okay i am in Waco is that right oh okay yeah laughter right down the street oh credit cards my favorite subject laughter you mean you use credit cards oh do i uh i bet you used them all up over Christmas yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off and then your are in debt and so then you have no money laughter so you use a credit card i understand that so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is do you use them a lot well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because you get Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way as long as you pay it off every month it doesnt cost you anything yeah yeah well that is a good idea that is what i that through a Visa but uh i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh if i can get away with paying them off every month it is alright if i dont then it gets laughterexpensive yeah that is my problem i dont try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know laughter so i have got myself well you shouldnt do that you you you never you you you never get out of the hole that way exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them so it is kind of strange kind of like the federal government right oh yeah exactly like the government laughter in never never get out of debt in debt for and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right yeah yeah have they put the cap on the interest rates i didnt know if they actually did that or not i know they were  i know they were considering it just the people who dont need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so uhhuh yeah vocalizednoise laughter funny how that works isnt it laughter laughter  thou thou who doesnt need credit gets cheap credit i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it well i think so because the because of the economy yeah thats right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you yeah i have a credit union we have a Master Card or Visa too vocalizednoise yeah they do uhhuh you got that one yes i do laughter yes i do a matter of fact who who do you work for uh i work for Channel six its its an NBC affiliate down here i do a lot of work down in Waco a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there oh really oh okay where do you work what is your i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh oh okay Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there oh okay so you probably work with uh uh what is the boy from here you ever work with Davis Davis Iron yes yep matter of fact i just saw them last week yep Davis Iron Work yeah oh okay and uh what else are are you in that part are you in the south part of town now yeah well i live actually in Hewett oh yeah okay yeah right outside so that is where Davis Iron Works is you know you know uh Parker Machine Tool down there  uh Bobby Parker i dont think i have seen that one i am sure i pass by it or something but i am not sure there is a place in Hewett called it is a new company called Prime Air that is in Hewett just around the corner from Davis Iron Works huh Prime Air yeah they make uh humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that its a new kind oh okay have you ever been to Marlin uh yeah i think it is Marlin or Mart they have uh uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or oh really i cant think of i cant think of the name but i will have to stop in there i went i have gone through there uh my oldest son goes to AM and oh yeah he is working on his Masters the Navy sent him there for his Masters mostly in Engineering so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five that is about the last time i have been through Marlin and Mart uhhuh oh i dont like that drive i make that drive sometimes we have stories out there but there is always a state trooper down there you have got to drive careful huh laughter oh really i know between Mart and Marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour oh goodness they they are bad at Hewett too on eighty four they are real bad that is where i got my last ticket so of course i couldnt pay that on a credit ,credit_card,3751
well i suppose we both have credit cards umhum yeah they seem to be a part of life laughter yeah how do you use them well i do use them um i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh they all can build up uh i think theyre handy i just get uh i dont carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks when you go shopping well do you use credit cards  yeah i use a few i um i watched my grandmother go into debt laughter on them and so ive and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so your grandmother huh  basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um i generally and my husband it turns out ive just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month thats good oh thats thats wonderful  so that we dont pay any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what were spending well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what youre savings is bringing its really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building yeah yeah thats what i feel but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand umhum its really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bills going to come but sometimes i forget and so you know vocalizednoise a bill will come in and ill think oh no i didnt know it was going to be that high but so far ive been able to weve been able to pay it off every time so um yeah well thats good im looking right now im kind kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them have gotten higher and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and theyre supposed to i dont know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didnt write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think its eighteen percent or something so think i want to find something that has a lower rate yeah have you ever used Discover card no i havent yeah im not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it laughteroff but you know is is that the one from Sears um i think Sears originally put it out but its um its pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh ive havent found many places that dont take Discover and theres no annual service fee which is good you know and then um they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or laughtersomething but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back uhhuh oh oh they give you money back for using your credit card yeah basically thats it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but im not sure oh i didnt know that hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards i worked with at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so you know now theyll take the Discover but i still dont know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two yeah i think its best to keep the number down laughter that you have umhum yeah ive got some that i you know i havent even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldnt be able to use them but uh i i do like my Dillards i have to admit thats one of my favorite places to shop and i do do use Dillards probably as more than any of the other department stores well do you have anything else to say or well yes no not too much more about credit cards laughter laughterokay i dont think i do either so well it was good talking to you okay well good talking to you Beth okay have a good evening byebye good luck you too bye ,credit_card,3781
so what do you think about the uh income taxes well i could do with a lot less than that where do you live i live in Dallas okay i live in Dallas too oh good well i live in Plano in that case laughter  okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i oh yeah i do yeah yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax it i think its like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there Washington DC was only six percent and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half i know it was only four percent and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i dont know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and thats how it started with uh four percent five percent umhum umhum and all of a sudden here we are now and its horrible since theres no uh state tax i assume that thats why it went up fast because Virginia does have a state tax  well its true but they did without it all those years umhum hm and they keep talking about the state tax and theyll probably put one in and theyll have this too so  yeah it  if they put state tax in i mean ill be pretty upset because i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck uh every two weeks and uh  if that comes back in ill be pretty mad because sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know so uh i dont know im not very much for a for state tax well i hope it doesnt but you know how it goes so laughter yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing theyre putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because of that yeah they said uh to build okay raise them apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes but it seems like it would pay itself off oh well it will so you know laughter whats the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know probably the first season yeah so you know but theyre funny about things like that here yeah things like that you know they really are when i came here you couldnt buy beer couldnt buy a drink laughter nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know no huh so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws umhum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesnt bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe but uh  like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh oh that is on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year and thats a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you dont forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year that is but that gets real expensive oh yeah that is do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know uh uh they well they do a little bit but um its its like next to nothing ive seen it its on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks it costs what so its only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they wont renew your registration till you pay your property personal property tax and i had a i vocalizednoise i paid you know twelve hundred dollars laughtera laughteryear for my last car for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess thats not too bad but other than that everything worked out yeah so you havent been here very long whats that you havent been here very long ive been here about two years now two years but uh in the two years ive ive been here ive been through ive had two cars so ive never really like you know i dont know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax uh yeah on the car other than what i paid when i registered uh registered the car so thats the only thing i can really think of so so do you work for TI or you just doing this no i dont im a nurse i work down at Presbyterian okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought itd be kind of cool yeah oh it is you know theyre supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least thats what i heard that you could could get to do ten calls oh do they really yeah i i dont know how the thing works uh and this is like the seventeenth oh really laughter all right you yeah so its great ,taxes,3782
 hello okay so you were with TI huh  yeah ive been with i was with uh TI for uh thirty four years so obviously i found something worth worth doing there and have prejudices about uh what i want laughter  well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right yeah uh where do you work i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i cant really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time and uh i think most people dont necessarily realize the cost of them and theyre somewhat probably getting out of hand laughter yeah they uh im not sure what the categorys supposed to be uh but it was what vocalizednoise something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company i think uh oh the way i got other other than salary didnt it say yeah right well no it didnt necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess well im i thought it said other than salary but yeah such as well i i imagine thats what theyre referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with ChanceVought before i joined uh there and ironically i left ChanceVought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company laughter laughter and they grew up around you didnt it laughter and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh then it became Dallas Countys largest employer oh but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh vocalizednoise besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job well i think thats one of the keys that most people uh probably put above benefits thats why i work for myself basically too laughteri laughterwant laughterto laughterdo laughterwhat laughteri laughterwanna laughterdo well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time and vocalizednoise its amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them vocalizednoise uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing right right and power and they they just couldnt understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others uh including IBMs that in the technical community salary was never first laughter it was usually about third and  yeah well i think as long as its comparable with you know the job or can that uh you arent being laughter picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary yes yes and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you laughterknow because because they just couldnt believe laughterthat that people werent motivated by money well i i wouldnt say they arent motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh yeah well im sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but live with for a while anyway until you had enough laughterto laughterdo laughterwhat laughteryou laughterwanted laughterto laughterdo but laughter in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could get you could get a job elsewhere anytime any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing ,job_benefits,3786
think of the job benefits you have well i i think uh so far theyve been pretty pretty good except the medical uh not not the medical the dental insurance the dental insurance yeah i yeah i think um um do you work for TI okay hum i know i went to have a tooth pulled and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldnt uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing laughter condition you know how you wait you wait as long as you can sometimes to to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it really vocalizednoise i i just thought that was that was pretty bad hm that does sound pretty bogus and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell fell off and uh they paid for the the cap but they wouldnt pay for the build up that sounds kind of strange and i didnt understand that laughtereither whos your whos your dental care through uh well uh its its a part of Aetna ours is through uh Cigna and its not too bad i mean i havent i havent been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits and uh they havent been bad they havent uh theyve been pretty good how about your uh do you have an HMO or well i had an HMO up to this year i switched you you went to like a regular plan vocalizednoise yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh oh okay you know because did it get expensive or yeah its gotten expensive because right now im im only i only have myself so i dont have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know umhum umhum umhum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh laughter i personally i i think HMOs are scammy now laughter just because uh its only five dollars a visit every time i go thats not bad okay and its five dollars prescription every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking you know laughter and so if i go to make a like i i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor and they wouldnt let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and im yeah that was a problem that i had with them toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them i got okay but uh and i didnt go back well i was just really annoyed with them because i uh i i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you dont give me an appointment im just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill yeah thats what i thought about later i wouldve probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill umhum umhum and and thats thats the only way youre going to get any action out of them you know if you threaten them with that laughteryou laughterknow because i said i just had the accident and i dont wanna wait too long before anything happens theyre like well wait another day and call us back and im like i dont wanna wait another day i want an appointment now yeah after i really thought about it some more the i i really couldve done that but um i was hospitalized uh uh about three years ago i had some surgery and Kaiser was really good for that because i didnt have to pay any of it at all yeah its its real handy once youre you know if you like my roommate broke his arm and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like i dont know im im only twenty four years old you know i dont really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years ive only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical  yeah so you know for me you know i dont i dont see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know  yeah so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible well i went to the doctor once and it cost me ninety laughterbucks laughterso it was like oh well i guess i couldve done pretty good with the five dollar visit yeah  well my uh my Kaiser premium  would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year wow thats a lot and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that hum yeah Kaisers expensive i mean i think its uh this year its like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars so i went back to Aetna because i i wont have to pay anything yeah that works that works out pretty handy and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick no yeah you know it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best ,job_benefits,3789
 card yourself or uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years weve tried to cut them back a little laughterbit and and uh down to mainly mainly one each uh uh its its easy to let them get out of control laughteryeah its i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and seen people with you know theyve had well ive seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits and about twenty thousand dollars of it used and i and we weve got one but its just for absolute laughteremergencies we hardly ever use it oh vocalizednoise laughter yeah yeah thats uh thats what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those for sure yeah they uh they can like you laughtersay you can once you start using them they theyre always real real willing to raise those limits for you laughter thats for sure yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they dont have to be as credit conscious they can no they can afford to write off a lot more yeah they can write off a lot more losses now uh which which i kind of disagree uh with id rather them going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates yeah  thats  excuse me yeah thats true i uh well i cant see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i cant imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because theres yeah i ive heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have yeah well that make you you know that makes sense i guess if theyre theyre not willing to write off as much but you know it theres a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we sent well take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars cost or a year for the just the fee and everything it yeah  i dont know i just i have a hard time i like i say i working in a financial institution i just im really rate conscious i guess and cant see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy well yeah well well people people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they dont look at at spending uh eighteen percent laughter on on credit its uh for some reason they dont look at it that way yep theres i imagine theres theres quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they dont have to charge you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that cant pay it off monthly and get thats thats true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them off but theres sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them off but yeah thats true but the people who who cant afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it its sort of like the federal government laughter laughteryeah laughterexactly thats true but yeah i uh i i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt theyve got it just seems like theyre they right now they cant afford to buy anymore because theyre up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know thats part of the reason i think everythings kind of stalled out but yes thats right well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh uh i think it would only mean that theyd theyd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and theyd probably make just as much money they just wouldnt write off as many losses that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass through through that through Congress they the thing that Congress didnt realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to pick things up but it would just it do wouldnt do any good because you know the banks arent stupid theyre going to realize that they cant you know they cant keep affording to write off five percent if theyre only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent yeah thats thats right yes uh well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didnt look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and thats in uh in real estate and other things and its the same with credit cards thats true thats true i dont know what will happen like i say were sure trying we we just got the one and we just dont want to get any more yeah we i i use a company one somewhat uh uh to to uh do air travel and all but uh i make sure that ones always uh paid off because im responsible for the interest on that one if laughter if i dont pay it off uh uh if its not huh huh where do you work at i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you dont have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so oh do you uh yeah so you just use your card but its but its in your name so its up to you to pay it off and and because its American Express you cant run up a a credit on it so that turn in the voucher ,credit_card,3800
um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our moneys worth hey listen if i had my way i wouldnt pay my taxes not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night no i did not i was well they did a  thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we dont need and uh well how does this grab you how does this grab you its staggering um this i i mean im im a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was uh about the NEA and thats the National Endowment for Arts and they fund they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money well there are a lot of things that people i think generally and then it just frosts me terribly well i think its interesting to look at um where the money vocalizednoise goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i dont think generally i think whats interesting is that  we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with i believe thats true yes and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us thats correct i mean and i think its gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh heavy involvement from the public yeah right thats your i think thats the only thing thats gonna change it and yeah heavy involvement from the public our our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part um ive ive said for years that theres full employment for the politically active and in our society uh theres very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyers uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting  which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve thats not a formula for a better society no it is not its lopsided very much so and the government really plays a role in this uhhuh thats right they pull the strings i mean vocalizednoise well well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful interest right the yeah laughter you know and its really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others dont and they think its unfair and when they recognize its their tax money theyre gonna do more about it i think ill tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about whats going on in this country they expect  opening it for one hour that theyll get three hundred thousand telephone calls im sure they will and ive thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think thats coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then i think you know its gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our moneys worth and as you said its how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or i like this or i dont like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i dont think is art yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it  well thats the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it  is telling us more you know about the problems so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out weve wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country oh absolutely over a very long period of time right absolutely um and uh we only see the tip of the iceberg its only you know theres so much of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture laughter well you may be right vocalizednoise what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say its its a ,taxes,3805
do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting  well  for many many years uh my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth and um that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we dont have quite such a tight financial laughtersituation so it its uh its been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we dont really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so were we dont have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did oh well we dont have a real strict budget um we have a a low budget to work on but we um you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we we just spend about so much we dont sure uhhuh i i dont know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there umhum  a certain amount i think ive i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i i have enough food already stored here that i dont have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there as the salt goes out or we need sugar or laughtersomething like that wow thats great  yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal personal storage oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient laughter laughter well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall when if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up so its its worked very well that way at least that way we  you know if each of us finds something is missing uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it yeah well thats a good idea that way we can keep up to date  lets see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was if you if i dont all i can think of is if you dont keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um  one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there and um this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive and  well actually its more interesting too if youve got the time  huh oh yeah and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare and so um  we find that if were careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then um somewhere in out in the wash itll come out that we have enough to get back there you know sure well i think we unconsciously  do the same thing excuse me my throats not as clear today as it should be uhhuh thats right uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip so that that is another way of uh budgeting uhhuh thats right and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we dont throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice yeah well whenever laughter i dont know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will ill probably pick it up laughter laughter i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter laughter yeah i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in  count it up at the end of the year something   yeah yeah laughter but yeah well lets face it then when we talking budget it is important to to have a budget  and uh i i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking checking account and i have a money market account also and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum and im always trying to ,family_finance,3813
credit cards laughter ill tell you what i i cant say a whole lot about credit cards because i uh tore mine up is that right i i know people i know some other people that have done that yeah uh i got in some problems with uh  financial problems because of credit cards so i uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and you know uh one that i use just for  emergencies but yeah i have i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and werent going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and theyre still paying away to get out of debt i know it  but no i did vocalizednoise just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh parents footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually but i uh i basically never charge anything i dont have the money in the bank to pay for and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah oh is that right thats a thats a good policy yeah and it you know i mean they theyre just a convenience for me i dont have to get cash out of the laughterbank and i dont have to to be writing checks and and uh yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases im glad i dont because i you know unfortunately i i i dont have the control you have laughter i wish i did but but i dont uh and it you know it i just dont want to get into that situation again so well yeah uhhuh yeah i mean it its easy i mean you you know you dont have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know laughter oh thats it see and thats even with my gas card you know i find that ill go in to get some gas and ill end up buying you know  candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and im thinking what did i get surprising laughter that costs so much yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there youre not going to youre not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right that thats true but i can i can understand certainly understand where  now i with the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know laughter not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly you know oh yeah isnt it thats unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you that i im uh thirty three thirty three thirty two excuse me vocalizednoise laughter  youll be thirty three this year laughter you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh its coming yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates its uh its unbelievable you know i just vocalizednoise that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and shes from there and and uh didnt really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but shes paying it and uh i just wont do it i mean shes paying i dont know i dont know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money ill go to the bank and uh oh jeez yeah and then you bet thats uh yeah i in fact ive ive even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh rates oh yeah and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know and i i guess theres some theres uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh call you know if youve got a pretty good rating uh credit rating you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or ill just go to somewhere else well i might you know and if youve got if youve got a pretty good uh uh history with them theyre more than willing to do that hum i might try that because i i have one card that ive had for about uh i dont know nine or ten years yeah in fact thats thats what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says thats you know hes tried it several with several of his cards and hes just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent it does not make sense for me to do that and if you wont drop my rates ill just go ahead and send you back your card and ill go somewhere else and get it yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i wont get any card now ive ive got a good rating and ive got laughter you know and im not going im not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first ,credit_card,3821
hello how you doing im Lee with uh uh im over here in Plano Texas hello fine okay let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off okay oh sure  where are you calling from or where are you at Arlington Arlington Texas yes Arlington well theres a  lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days yes not all good stuff are you involved in any of that no no no im not not personally  well uh what benefits uh do now do you work  im going to school right now i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husbands or what i think ive got a lot of oh you are okay   yeah because i i work for myself and so uh  uh theres a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh yes right yes ive been in my own business Mary Kay in fact im selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having oh is that right that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits werent there so yeah i uh  i own part of a roofing company oh do you yeah in the in the Dallas Fort Worth area and uh you you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we  we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i i uh i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and yep umhum being able to you know work when i want and i think today the thing that i uh would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine and were the only one that im the only one thats being insured oh is that right and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children have i mean laughterso laughterits laughterkind laughterof and i would i really and the way medical expenses are its a i think thats probably one of the biggest benefits to have you need to have yeah it really probably it probably yeah ill tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it its out of sight right its out of sight and uh yeah even at a group rate i couldnt believe how much is our oh yeah even at a group rate uh its its unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and and if you want to add dental to it i mean thats right it goes up right that eats even more so  yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh  that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know and course these days you cant count on that because laughter uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh vocalizednoise GM deal there in in Arlington and im im sure itll be you know quite a few people are affected by that so right its going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool they were paid that whole time and i dont know if youre aware of this right yes oh really they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and im sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great i i really believe they have done this to themselves  is that right in a way because of the unions being so strong  the Union yeah and right now anybody thats laid off from GM will have a full years paycheck i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the workers stuff that they have at is that right at uh through the company so im sorry you know im sorry its happening because its going to hurt but i dont feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow wed get one more check and that would be it well really the yeah really the ones its gonna hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area you know thats the ones that that thats going to hurt because they depend on that uh  yes oh yeah thats already hurting yeah but i think theres a case where benefits have gotten they voted them in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know oh yeah and it made the prices of cars go up and and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far well i tell you i  ive had my fill of unions laughter i use i mean i cant make eighteen dollars an hour i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour oh yeah ,job_benefits,3830
 do you use credit cards convenience uh laughter i i use them for just uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard do you but um i i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um  uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one uh has a twenty dollar its a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i i pay off every month theres no interest charge i see but and we never carry over we pay off every month what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you dont pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa well one thing is whenever we rent a car we dont have to pay um any extra insurance so that we uh my husbands uh family lives in New Hampshire and uh its about ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card i see i see we used to get the American Express card and stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we dont do or other types of services im sure therere some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh ive just wondered what they were they havent been appealing to us so far no uh unless theres some no i theres no uh unless theres some advantage theres not any point theres theres no prestige laughterfactor laughterinvolved yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know youve arrived youve got this card and uh you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh oh dear so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i dont know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa Visa and laughterMasterCard and they said fine well give it to you anyway and we said you know were uh were not interested in your card anymore and they said well wait a minute is is it the price laughterand laughterwe said yeah so well we wont charge anymore laughter you know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year or something like that twelve dollars something like that yeah uhhuh theyre wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and its wonderful in that respect and were glad to have them we we can can you buy groceries with it uhhuh yeah its great you know and it eventually what were gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and itll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i dont think the Discover cards gonna make it in the long term um you know we dont need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but itll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because the price will come down yeah i think so too i dont think its worth fifty five bucks a year no its not when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and theyre pitching that in all their commercials i notice yeah you really can and uh also um we travel abroad and um it um you get MasterCards accepted everywhere and and you get the a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in travelers checks of course there are well now now thats interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the vocalizednoise conversion fee probably yeah and and even uh converting your travelers checks at a bank they still charge you a fee and uh well it its gonna come that way and the reason its nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources anywhere in the world and thats where were headed  the technology supports that nicely and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen and you dont get uh anything charged to you and thats great its just insurance were very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them yeah umhum umhum itd be great to know we didnt have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever  um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA yeah we do too laughter yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh  thats a great thing for ,credit_card,3854
yeah i pushed in so how do you use your credit cards oh we use them for paying our gas for paying uh just about anything because um we dont like to pay for our checks laughter so we use it quite a bit but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards if theres a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where its free so we never have to pay anything extra yeah thats me i wont use one that i have to pay an annual fee yeah we just dont think its worth it you know and um im uh like you i i use it well to buy my gas with my Shell my Shell credit card i use that and then like my Emporium card and uh Weinstocks card i use that but im like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i dont just write a check i dont know see well you i dont do it either laughter you know its just really weird but i i dont carry a lot of cash with me because im always afraid that someones going to steal my purse yes exactly thats how i feel i mean its a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse yeah you know enough for a phone call and thats about all but uh other than that thats the thats the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that theyve got they cant they cant charge any more you know and i think thats terrible yeah because its really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something oh yeah yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why it really does help yeah and i think its more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever and then um you know we really dont have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later uhhuh uhhuh and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a little even a little bit ahead because weve been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later uhhuh uhhuh yeah well i think its better to use credit cards too like i say because you theres so many people around any more thats watching what youre doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket oh yeah theyre going to hit you over the head yeah even if its five bucks even i know it just uh vocalizednoise you know it just seems like theyre somebodys always watching so i just dont i dont carry money id just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think its twenty four hours you can report it in and i he said the most youd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt youd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then you know you can have your card back with yeah right pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever yeah right and you know some of those stores dont even seem to check your signature or anything i know you know i dont know why they dont unless you have to spend a certain amount i dont know but i notice that some of them dont even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you yeah exactly you know so i dont think thats right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know yeah sure i mean its just a precaution for everybody uhhuh uhhuh yeah so well lets see what else can i say about credit cards oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year yeah i dont i dont uh that that thats that Sears Discovery Card is that what that yeah yeah yeah now i dont have that one you know well we just started doing that and you know what it comes in handy is for when youre buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes because theyll give you some money back you know and its only a little bit but i mean its still something we got two fifty last year uhhuh uhhuh and so its you know it helps out here and there oh you mean uh vocalizednoise for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesnt sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything youve youve charged up on the Discover card for a year and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something oh i see and so thats what and i know were going to get back more this year because they you know we spent a little bit more probably and they do it for how long youve been a member i think too um i see and they increase the percentage a little bit yeah well ill ,credit_card,3855
what what you have some ideas on the to help out the President here i think that uh one of the things theyre going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at whats important and what has a return on investment uh theres an awful lot of federal programs that uh they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good right i i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at and theres some things some programs that just dont seem to be working at all uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs theyre just seem to be self perpetuating and uh uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they dont have much interest and there is no uh uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesnt get continued theres theres a lot of waste as a result i think of that well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family so thats resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around well uh i and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing yeah i think theres uh theres a good opportunity if theyll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh if and combine the savings there with with the savings in all these uh give away programs and and then waste thats in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that dont do any good i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation well there was a there was a study i dont know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission I know that uh and it it he was uh a private uh individual and he did a study on on cutting waste out of government and he came up with i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on well i know that uh well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator and work out a a one or two page cost proposal and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and thats the same in government i guess its is it all necessary you know and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does uh and i i think one of the problems were having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh but but when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor and now it seems like theres uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers yeah well and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and thats something the government has never really tried hard to do uh they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have uh theres no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when youre going into debt to do it and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things uh we have a a new sewage treatment facility near here thats uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water and they have an administrative building associated with it that uh has ,budget,3881
the federal budget  boy i was just writing something down that came to mind as i observed whats happened in our society we i think have become uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself i agree with that and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that we have elected people who really dont know how to manage the money uh they collect  well what weve got um in my view is  is a situation where  weve got more people like you say that are customed that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research thats now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT i mean were talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption yeah well i i really i think if you  from a vocalizednoise laughteri laughtermean uh you know i hate to admit that in a way but its true yeah i i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think were gonna have to eventually balance the budget or were gonna sink we cant continue to pay the kind of interest that were paying on the deficit right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world thats true there are lot of things we dont we dont need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we dont need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy farm i mean basically you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are its not that we dont have the resources we are just squandering them oh yeah throwing them away uh its just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they dont spend their allotment uh thats the way it was working on a defense department contract thats what happened vocalizednoise then theyre then theyre subject to losing the next years allotment right well thats the way the thats the way the thing works yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the end at year end thats right ive seen that happen and its it whats even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations  is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because were the smart guys and without us society cant function and that thats no license to steal right thats true i mean i i honest to God believe thats what whats been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts well and and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable its no longer acceptable well and well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if its if there if its federal money then its free money well its not it costs everybody and uh it you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh uh that doesnt necessarily make it morally uh responsible right and it its not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldnt survive and do a a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought theyd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and well and and and vocalizednoise well dont even began to talk about the educational system i mean is that is one example where its being proven that throwing money does not create a good education okay well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they havent been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if its that good and you really yeah but im even talking im im not even im not even talking about higher education were im talking about the the kids that weve got now they come out of high school that cant read and write and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them right but all the people laughterwho who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges uh true okay and my point is hey wait a minute somethings wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if its the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around okay so ask yourself some questions why dont we have a higher quality with one of the worlds great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education i mean this is a focus its not like this isnt an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they cant produce something like MTV which kids want ,budget,3894
 do you feel youre paying too much in tax oh i always feel im paying too much for everything laughter thats part of my problem i wonder if we wouldnt be better off um you know with a little more free enterprise than having the government do some much for us thats what my i dont know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price i think youre right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a sort sort of a habit of investing in things that dont pay much return and into getting into projects that uh there is no yield on the investment so its all money down the rat hole yeah it doesnt it doesnt seem like we really get our uh i dont know i i dont think we get the best for the buck if thats if thats a good way to put it but um  uh do you now do you live close to uh uh you know to a government installation of any kind or no im uh sort of in Fairfax County working for uh one of the uh free loaders on the government uh government contract uh group uh oh okay so you know it from the contract side so you know somebody once accused uh accused us of uh uh being a welfare program for engineers laughter laughter yeah my father worked uh for the government uh here in Utah at the Hill Air Force Base where i mean you know that was the occupation that he had all the time i was growing up and and we got a good living out of it but i know just from talking with him there were it was like you said there are a lot of things that go on that just just make you wonder that they dont really even get the best out of the people that are working for them so it makes me wonder where were where were going with that well i think my father went through his life saying that he just keeps paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes and he never laughtergot laughteranything laughterout laughterof laughterthe laughtergovernment laughterfor laughterit well they uh uh yeah they they they provide a lot of services that we dont you you know that we dont really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system well the welfare is a good example that uh you know if if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that that get people involved directly uh then the money gets right straight to the people and theres a lot of volunteer work and and supporting that type of operation but you let the government handle it and next thing you know youre spending four out of five dollars just to administer it yeah i and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people i think i think thats a really good point laughter because i i i think you know welfare is one of the one of the big problems and it its interesting that in uh in a way its interesting to me that that like in the foreign in Russia and those kind areas where theyre having their struggles right now you know theyre gonna have to have a welfare system in order for in order to improve their life over there and i i hope they dont pattern theirs after our laughter yeah well im afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what theyre gonna charge you next year but uh since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled and im just afraid that by the time im ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i wont be able to afford the taxes on it laughteryour monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i uh sold it the the tax payment was a bigger part of the uh yeah that is the of the mortgage payment  yeah hm that that is scary because that really makes you wonder what theyre doing with that i and i figure it just says that uh when im ready to retire im gonna have to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place uh and theres no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay youre assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh you know theres no recourse and what what do you think you get out of your taxes your property taxes well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services uh and i i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system im a little concerned that theres too much paper work there for them ,taxes,3906
you think health benefits probably the the most important yes for because most people are aging getting older and the benefits uh the benefits are going up i mean the price is going up thats true that everything seems to go laughterup that thats the case or the problem i have im getting older and uh the wife and uh we use the doctors more have um more health problems and that is a very important benefit that uh yeah see here where well here where i live all the benefits have been going up lately up on health and there are hospitals that have we have a one cent tax and then now Bush is coming up with this health plan so i dont know much much about it then no ive i havent really studied that too much but uh that is one of the benefits that uh  that i feel that uh is real good with uh the company i work for so far but uh it its uh you know whats gonna happen their costs keep going up as you say and its uh it could wipe a a family out or uh all your savings and everything one one serious illness yes laughter yeah one illness will do it i think thats uh one of the benefits that we really need to our companies need really need to take a look at because theres so many Americans that are not covered at all thats uh quite a situation i think the other thing uh security and that thats getting pretty tough now a a a job with security uh especially if youre in uh department of defense or youre in the auto industry been working for fifteen or twenty years and all of a sudden uh because of changes in Europe this uh holidays holidays so many people are losing their jobs and uh i dont know how you can as as a benefit how you could have have security as one but most people like to have that security in their jobs yeah i would i would think so well thats one of the main main i would think one of the main securities that you would need is health benefit ill say yeah it really is and uh its uh you really feel sorry for those who dont have it or they have a uh cancer or something real serious that uh could runs up their uh transplant heart transplant or something runs up into uh um  hundreds of thousands of dollars that could wipe you out in a hurry well we i have my sister died and she had some benefits that helped through her well they had her hooked up and everything but that helped her helped us through it good good good a good thing that uh they she had those i think theres other uh well theres other benefits that uh kind of or look at i guess uh need a vacation once in a while most jobs do that uh give you some time off and uh thats something that uh each companys a little different on that but most of them are pretty good on those uh those type of benefits i think umhum just just with the benefits going up its just theres not a whole lot you can do about it really no there isnt and another one i think is uh quite important of course is retirement system that they they have and uh with social security and uh the way it is if thats all you got is social security by then youre not gonna make it very far laughter right by the time i get up there uh in a few years and uh draw social security with the cost of living uh that benefit is just really not gonna help very much no i dont think laughterthat laughterwould uh the older the older you probably you would probably need more help because you know a lot of elderly most of the elderly people dont have the money and the ones that do well they have insurance so umhum yeah its its just a i think it they need to extend them because were were paying here a lot umhum yes i think the elderly needs it more than anything thats true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you and that just takes away your buying power also and uh the company of course i can see the companys side uh too because uh they have to pay uh an a proportion of whatever the the health cost is and it gets to the point where uh theyre not uh making money and uh it uh i dont wanna see us to go socialized medicine like they are in England or places like that but still uh i i hope that this plan that uh the Presidents come up with uh is gonna help all those or help some way bottom line though whos gonna pay for it laughter really have they got it have they already signed that or thats not signed yet is it no no he he just uh proposed it and uh the republicans are saying hey its a great plan the democrats say its no good so well they ,job_benefits,3941
 were talking about taxes taxes right you think you think you pay too much all right well you is what they said and do you think youd get what you pay laughterfor thats hard to say you know i think it take a lot for granted you know and its the the quick answer i think would be that you pay too much taxes you know but but i think if you think about it um all the highways we have all the uh federal programs we have whether theyre good or bad um sure seems like you do get a bang you know it seems like a lot of stuffs going on even though every paycheck a lot of moneys coming out um i dont know i dont know it seems like so i used to think that government spent too much and they probably do but you know when you go to your doctor your doctors private also and uh theyre gonna charge you a good buck for whatever theyre doing also so well what do you think well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i dont think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas we could do better in a private sector i think it just ive done some reading on this and some and in some of the areas you know youre lucky to get back a a dime on a dollar on some programs uh but i also know that people to me wont do what they should do to help each other and they wouldnt have so much government if we did and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicines coming which i hate to see but i think because theres so many people without insurance thats whats coming you know its coming yeah its needed so uh but no i dont probably feel like i get back what i pay now you do you pay state income tax in yeah i i pay actually state city and federal yeah see here a lot of people think in Texas were lucky because we dont pay um state income tax but they get us in other ways you know yeah well i i just figured it out today i get uh i think my my two week pay is sixteen hundred and eleven dollars or something like that sixteen sixteen something around there and my take home after taxes is about eleven  um yeah so five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out you know and obviously if you make you know forty thousand dollars a year youre paying ten thousand in dollars a year in taxes and everybody whos in that type of income is paying that i think thats another problem you know plus sales tax right  uh yeah well thats where they got us here you know every time they need something they up the quote users fees or the sin taxes you know on beer and such sure sure and plus you pay if you buy cigarettes you pay tax on that if you buy beer yeah so just because we dont have a state income tax they get us proportionately higher in other areas yeah yeah so i dont know you dont have a state income tax in Texas thats so yeah thats not so bad but they still have to get the money somewhere to they get it somewhere and and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax you can take it off you federal so we cant take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform but thats what they up it they up it on gasoline they up it on um say beer and cigarettes uh users fee drivers license license plates it all just keeps going up and up and up and they tell us its not really taxes laughteryou laughterknow laughteryou laughterknow laughterbut it is and uh no i dont know i dont know what the answer is to all this i think uh same difference i dont know i i think its a i i dont know i i think i think its like private like you said privatization is good because you know when the profit uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people arent going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh thats the attitude that uh at least my agency takes you know they they when they take the attitude that uh this is a business and and if youre not going to run it profitably then youre going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency and and its unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing and we make more money than we than we cost so uh well thats really unusual so nobodys ever going to question my salary or anybody else on my staff uh especially my unit because my unit is a revenue producing unit uh there are other you know things that that may i mean look at that i was talking to my father the other day about the NASA program you know he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff but yet then again they come up with all these scientific discoveries that may help save us sometime i mean i think it was NASA that weve learned a lot yeah you do learn a lot so youre not you you know youre paying all this money but youre getting something back for it uh you know military spending is the same thing whether you agree or you disagree with building all these bombs and stuff which i happen to have a tendency to disagree with uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether its right ,taxes,3945
okay Janet do you guys have a family budget we try to laughter like mothers im sitting im right this minute dishing up cheap spaghetti which is one way we try and keep within a budget laughter its probably why were participating too right laughter although im trying to raise money for a boy scout cause um actually how we do it is my husband and i both work and we try very hard to live on his salary and my salary goes automatically into a savings account which we try not to use too much although from that we both definitely we typically pay our credit cards from that account so thats the thats the uh our household expenses are pretty well covered because theyre pretty much the same every month but its our credit card spending that its always the problem yep is the cost of living uh high down there is it tough to i dont know what to compare it to i lived in Indiana and Saint Louis but i was a student then and you know when youre a student things dont mean much um i think Dallas is um i know its just a  relatively high priced homes but then theres not i think energy and some of the other things arent quite so high and i my my gestalt is that our groceries are sort of intermediate therere not as bad as i have seen in big cities like New York or California areas how about you um the cost of living here is cheap in in fact its really great weve got a a quite a nice home weve got a five bedroom home home with a basement in it and it cost me through let me see four years ago it cost me fifty five thousand so its great i mean uh uh that is laughter where are you from originally right here in Idaho from from Idaho yes ive got a brother in law in Plano Texas and thats how we got hooked up with this uh TI deal but its well i dont know anyone from Idaho im from Indiana um and i have a great love for the Midwest would go back in a minute if i could laughterbut i married a Texan they dont always tell you that they have a homing instinct well thats good but i our home uh we have a five bedroom home um but its more in the range of with around two hundred forty thousand so about four and a half times your home im sure theyre probably quite comparable yeah right or maybe i dont know ours is nice our home is nicely located but i dont think the house itself is yeah well i i wouldnt uh mines not nicely located i probably got a bargain i think more particularly extraordinary  how about budget wise how how do you do a family budget are you married yes i am and my wife is very meticulous about budgeting she has a computer program in fact im an accountant im a CPA im calling you from work tonight uh but uh my wife runs every single check she spends through a computer and she can tell me on a monthly basis and shes more interested not me in fact i only look at it once a year when i do our we do our taxes but she can tell you every month exactly what shes paid for groceries and uh utility bills and for gasoline in the cars and everything shes uh uh my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we used the Managing Your Money software package with Andrew Tobias he is familiar with that one yeah im not im not uhhuh well i mean now im sure there are a million software packages but um he tried very hard and we were all computerized and we our regular monthly checks we printed you know um and i hated i did it for three years and hated every minute of it laughter and still founded about half of our checks maybe a third i still hand wrote because it would be like in the school parking lot or you know at my childs skating lesson or something like that so we had to come we had two checks two sizes of checks vocalizednoise excuse me baside Beth right there easide my daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is um so we we tried and it was pretty nice one of one mistake i think we made in that is that um for budgeting purposes in terms of putting it in a budget we must have had eighty different categories and so they they became sort of nonsensical instead of i always said if we had redone it we should have just put big categories like utilities and you know luxuries laughterand entertainment that sort of thing we have about twenty five categories is all probably and we write all of our checks out of the register we dont try to do any through the computer and then my wife just sets down when shes got about an hour and just keys them all in and its really not you know that bad it um well i dont know it might it mightve been tough for you but she enjoys it and thats another thing too she really enjoys it she uh laughter well i see laughter i suppose thats the key um just gets a thrill out of seeing where her money went i guess do you does your wife work outside the home she does shes she teaches at um a small two year college here shes uh teaches uh business communications oh my goodness well with a CPA and a business person you should be organized uh yeah uh laughteri laughterdont laughterknow we still have problems with money like everybody else ,family_finance,3978
 okay Bill um as you think over the plans and so forth that the company youre working with now who do you work with this time well i own a company you own the company alright im the president and CEO of the company my goodness so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are yeah i guess you do but uh you so what are you asking me what vocalizednoise what benefits i think are most important well what what do you think of the lets put it this way what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary um id say in todays economy uh besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the uh some type of retirement plan id say that uh most of the employees uh um that we have really like a a profit sharing plan a profit sharing plan thats interesting umhum they like to participate in the profits of the company like theyre part like you know because they feel like well were contributing to it so wed like to participate in it and so that means i make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working yes because they  they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job i think most people uh dont want money um its been my experience most people want uh to feel like theyre participating in something that uh that is not a drudgery you know that they can enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of and its a contribution well Bill uh that idea fits me exactly i just retired from uh the university here and thats been the goal of my life was to contribute and um to the work that i was doing in my research and thats what made me happy and uh thats the type of goal i think most people ought to look for and im sure a lot of them dont you cant stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that youre contributing something to a scientific laughterlevel of knowledge or so forth yeah well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction um were a financial planning firm youre a financial planning firm how many uh uh yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are uh retired or trying to retire laughter umhum oh and uh its real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh um that it take care of them they dont none of them really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable well what what changes would you have have you considered uh in in doing it to your to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is uh is tie um uh a percentage um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary and the result when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars oh okay umhum even though they didnt bring it in they help it once its there right well see we have different we have marketing people and then we have uh financial planners and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know that if we dont have their cooperation and theyre not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly and so uh were thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business and uh yes but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job but it might be whether the locality locality there those people want that kind of support well and and and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that theyre the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with uh it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it see we dont want anybody around here that says make me do it i dont think anybody any i think most people want to be lack a better terminology terminology they want to be self employed but they dont want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please thats true without some real strict adherence which thats what we have ,job_benefits,3985
well the topic is is very apropos to whats going on um how do you feel about our topic well i feel like uh i do feel like we pay a lot of taxes i dont mind paying a lot of taxes if the taxes taxes are spent well but uh im not convinced that theyre being spent well um um i think thats because uh its like i told someone the other day im a housewife and uh among uh working mother too and i know how it is to live on a budget and i hear what youre saying umhum umhum yeah our taxes its nice to see them spent for things that benefit the community but when we see them wasted thats when we think were paying too much well i feel i i mean one of the things is when its it its not going its going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent and not going into a lot of infrastructure things uh or or um you know social needs that that it could i mean when you look at the pie its it of where our money is spent its its uh very very um skewed and uh so i dont feel like i i just dont feel like theyre doing what i would do with it laughter well i think uh in a way thats thats uh almost off our topic in you know in that uh they didnt want us to talk about how it was spent but i dont think you can separate it i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent and uh in talking to people ive met from other places uh we do seem to get off light except you know if you ever make money one year now you pay all this horrible taxes and you dont get to keep laughterany laughterof laughterit well uh but the people who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services they have national health so you know uh oh yeah umhum in other words yes thats why i say in the other countries yeah so im saying if we did i wouldnt mind paying what we pay or even more if i got a lot laughterof stuff back for it but uh well on national health so many of them cant use it they say because they never can get in to see their doctors at least in England i we hear that here uh some although we get some people who obviously dont want it like like rich doctors laughter who whod rather us not have it i think but i dont know i i just and local taxes um i think are probably just about the same you know the school the school taxes and all of that income tax of course is not a a topic in in Texas yet but im sure its coming  umhum i hope it doesnt i uh i hope not but i dont see any way out of it unless we start cutting some spending drastically thats true ive lived in uh states where they had income tax and you you know and you just get used to it but uh again again um it just depends on what theyre what its being spent on course i i think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is because if you dont uh buy and participate you dont have to have to pay it  and uh that way people who use the facilities and live outside of the area basically help pay some of the upkeep for it yeah and sometimes and sometimes i think it does work that way um but they you know uh uh again its its you you you have the different kind of taxes then then then what are they being used for and who is deciding what they are being used for and how much is spent to administrate administrate them laughter right laughter laughter yeah all those people are doing those things and and and i know that the stories i mean i personally know people who have been in this place where you know they theyre having trouble paying their taxes and they uh like you would with a bank you know go into the IRS and say you know you can you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing or give me you know let me pay this out and youll get it all and theyll say no you laughterknow and i think now wait a minute that was my money you laughtersaid no with well well well youre not going to get it all uh thats right yeah and and one of the things that makes it so hard on these people they slap so much penalty and interest on it that they can triple it in nothing flat yeah i mean its the one place that theres no recourse at all and a lot of people arent trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back and they just they dont accept that at all so ,taxes,3992
 you said youre are financial uh financial planner so do you work with individual um like companies or i mean well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and um we do business and personal uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people so how do you handle your own account laughter how do i handle my own account your your own budget laughter uh well the first part of being of of a good budget or a good financial planner is to uh number one dont have any debt  so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also hm  right now i think really the only debt we have is our house and oh thats great youre ahead of most of the people out there then well good laughter but we really dont have a monthly budget that we live on but we dont spend um frivolously either uhhuh  uh i mean we dont i dont we dont have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know its not that rigid um well a budget does not have to be rigid hm um i know though im expecting and um were thinking about cutting down to one salary  and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our  income because i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um so i think when laughter laughterwhen laughterit laughtercomes laughterto laughterthat laughtertime period we are going to need to watch our our funds a little bit more um right now were struggling with it oh  the thing is that both our cars are paid off but they are the same age and his my husbands car is American mines Japanese but his is breaking laughterdown laughtera laughterlot laughtermore you know i havent had any problems and were were uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest you you know interest rate  well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it  we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to you know to stop taking that money out so theyve still been putting in oh i dont remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars well that is called smart budgeting oh good laughter smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart oh its real financial planning but were talking about budgeting so that is very smart to do and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments so its just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings and i i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are and uh well thats in our goals i guess for this year first quarter is to examine our financial standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i dont really see any benefit over um uh  oh i cant remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasnt enough difference in the interest rate to make a different i mean  to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um money money markets i dont know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but  right now i dont know what do you think the way things are going right now well uh um with the economy the way it is its very important that um we dont spend capital we dont have to because we dont know when well need it and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we dont have to work harder  and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergencies ,family_finance,4000
 uh well its nice to talk with you um oh i guess ill go ahead and start off with uh i think that theres two things that could be done that are procedural to  uh to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um i agree with that laughter uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress uh when theyre faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just dont have the the willpower on their own to uh to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district local politics yeah well also too often too the uh individual congressman has the uh especially if they are on on uh some of the committees that put these budgets together uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the line yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to yeah thats exactly right yeah one of the the uh theres a bill pending before congress which im trying to remember what its called its something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh uh uh you wouldnt be able to um put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they werent reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that and thats like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen uh because no one uh has uh it doesnt go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing theres another idea uh uh another uh way where the budget could uh probably benefit and this has to do of course uh it has to do with federal projects too often uh those are uh not theres no uh accountability once the uh projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with billions of dollars of overlay or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be for following up that if it goes over budget it it well you know its set up laissez faire attitude well thats to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldnt happen that way i agree and i think i think if there was more attention paid to uh whats being uh spent and more accountability that would help enormous enormously too are how who or how that would come about im not uh sure but thats an an an area that i think needs to be uh looked at yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is theres nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh laughter and i dont know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh we gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending well i think uh there could be a lot of consolidation of programs uh looking at of course there they have been a lot of talk to begin with but looking at and the  the militarys a big uh area that uh has taken a lot of shots recently but i i do not see the point of having four different services uh i do not see why they could not have one military service and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy thats right because a lot of the monies are spent uh with insiding within those departments how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the Far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves basically im in im in agreement with that uh i would think that there probably needs to be a uh monitor or not a monitor uh or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a well well always have a presence there but we dont we dont need to have half a million troops overseas no well witness witness the the recent Gulf War too even with uh troops all over Europe uh it took several months to gear up thats right and so what was the point of having them to begin with yeah another area thats that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid ,budget,4017
 vocalizednoise i pressed i pressed one all right uh on uh all right benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh theres a little more in backup when i need it do you work outside of the home yes i do i work for the school system Richardson school thats a pretty large corporation yes it is and uh retirements one of the good benefits and um health care has been a mess nooh yeah and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think thats a mess for everybody now isnt it pretty much yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around it keeps i yes for the best where it used to be one of your better you know you you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didnt have that problem yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one yes i think i do ive never worked for a small one so i cant tell you you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system well i think uh course im im a medical technologist and and in our line of work its awfully nice to not be out by yourself and thats the biggest benefit i find because um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations right right do you have good resources in your school district right we do have very good resources theyre excellent yeah to my mind thats the best thing for working for a big place and theyre um is how about you how do you feel about that well its an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it it is an important aspect as far as um being having having everything available to you the uh counseling and the whole whole ball of wax um umhum what would you like to change in your benefits well probably the major one would be the medical i would like to change see a better package for the money you know it but but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the do you have to pay medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you dont get any of that any more you know its all separate and its all so very high if you do get it yeah well ours is and thats very frustrating and it i cant imagine how the younger families do it well its its difficult laughter i know uh ours has improved over what it was because we just went to a larger corporation and thats what helped it improve but the one thing id like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost laughterpathetic so thats how id like to improve ours umhum i was i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and its not good though weve had to i mean were building our own you know oh well you have to you have to any more you cant count on companies on that any more that and thats another thing thats changed the the medical and the uhhuh you have to if youre smart retirement benefits from large corporations its kind of its its like it was set you know you were really set for life really well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and uh uhhuh yeah yep yep thats right right before yeah and thats thats kind of rough  thats yeah i remember um my mother talking in the forties for her her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that theyre doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and thats what theyre doing again its like a recycle of the whole when they see theyre gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or its getting close to a time yeah it happens they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they dont have to pay as high and yeah but uh course i think theyre losing an awful lot of valuable expertise oh vocalizednoise i do too and the wisdom behind it all its yeah and you know thats got to count thats got to add in all their production the whole works i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it yeah it was uh its expensive and i dont know why they dont build that into it but i guess well its cost again you know cutting costs ,job_benefits,4020
well uh i dont know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh there ought to be some at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this yeah see it like seems to me you know that everyones offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when its when its just such a bad time for it you know right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering it the ninety seven cents a week laughter yeah ninety seven cents a week now what thats really not gonna do a lot of good it doesnt seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a Coke or something for that hell i mean mostly you know its its not actually a a a cut its just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know um yeah i dont just dont see it changing my life style a whole lot nah that ninety seven cents really isnt gonna do it for me either uh i i havent really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates uh dont seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point umhum yeah i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know ill ill tell you right now im gonna raise taxes i believe it was Dukakis but i i cant it was Dukakis yeah i have a lot of laughterrespect laughterfor laughterhim yeah i mean thats better than George Bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i cant follow through on this but it seems to me that uh yeah umhum that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and were supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year well id really like to know where where that money is actually gonna go because in my opinion i dont think im ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend oh yeah laughter i know it its i mean if they could actually put put something together and make im not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever oh yeah i i yeah i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where it would it would it would help unemployment greatly right exactly exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infrastructure structure of the country and it yeah our infrastructure is in is in i mean we weve weve hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fifty fifty years of the cold war yeah yeah and and theres no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that were in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely dont hear anybody saying that right now umhum um yeah i i agree totally laughter um i mean we this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen um i im in college right now and oh really where do you go so am i uh IU right i go to Georgia Tech um and in my i had political you know the required political science class a couple of years ago and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situation how how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in eighty in the um tax year of eighty one um Ronald Reagan basically said you know im gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the Congress would not in the right mind pass and Congress Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the Democratic Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know slicing by by removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know what created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit and you just  i mean its just you you just have to wonder what theyre thinking in Washington i mean its just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun yeah uh well its its more than a loaded its a loaded cannon i mean theyve got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion dont do a very responsible job of spending that money umhum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well im gonna raise taxes and cut the budget and were gonna have you know were were gonna were gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldnt have a chance of getting elected oh no i mean its kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and for the for the moment and thats what really is getting me about what George Bushs stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that youll be happy come November and youll elect me again and then im gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesnt seem that its gonna make much of a difference umhum yeah that i mean i dont know i i laughter i dont i dont think George Bush will make the American people happy with laughterninety laughterseven laughtercents a week no no not at all well i just dont think it was a well thought out laughterincentive ,budget,4022
 okay um i guess were going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think uh next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh covering medical costs for yourself or family members well um does your company have good benefits in that  in that regard yeah i think i work for a a public school system district and uh  so its different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs but it overall um ive been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration oh yeah is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now were on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any how about yourself i see uh well im my medical coverage is with an HMO um so thats in my opinion thats getting thats bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um right yeah our district did that for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um i i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and ive never seen another bill so i i have to say it really works but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if youve been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people thats right yeah im im fairly young myself ive only been when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment and uh at that time i immediately joined the HMO and i never really so the only doctor i ive kind of consistently had has been through the HMO and uh you know for me its worked out real good right but if you you know have a family and and um everybodys gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i im sure it would be very stressful and my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as you know good so  yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch and i guess oh all right another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit i do too are you talking about like spring break and right right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation it it really um  i dont think most of our teachers now im not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but i dont think the teachers could stand the stress laughterall all year long frankly it is just Texas has really um you know they want everybody educated no matter what its costs uh and it it would be just we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i dont know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the laughterstaff what do you do there laughter right well um im not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and thats who i work with okay i like and were given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study well thats good yeah i would think that that type of employment youre youre one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um you know its good that they allow you that it um as i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get many days off and um we all look forward to it thats only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time oh yeah i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh ive just continued to uh stay there okay are there  are there any things that that youd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits ,job_benefits,4028
is all you need i think just one is all you need yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do yall have a family budget well we dont right now were planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue oh yeah ive heard of that youve youve heard of him its really its been really good weve um were on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know were gonna spend and um the rest we have in categories but for the most part its been somewhat discretionary um the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so we may spend a little more there and a little less in another in another area so um but its worked really well weve been able to save um you know what weve wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what weve wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing  well  we um i i keep the books and im the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend baside no you may not easide um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know  some people do um  envelope envelope envelope systems and stuff but i dont find that works real well for me well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain savings uh you know savings objectives yes we have um vocalizednoise we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and i mean where do you put that money uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of  it in CDs and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now were getting ready to put up a fence and that will come out of there its money that we havent budgeted for oh yeah it you know things you know things like that and then um thats where it will come from and if we dont have the money in there we have to wait until its you know up to where we where it needs to be thats probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted i im sorry i didnt i didnt hear you i say thats probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that youve planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or is that part of the system to discontinue that well he recommends that you dont um or he helps he recommends that you you get them down we weve never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um every month if we use them um were not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um  i dont know sometimes ill do mail order stuff and ill put it on there but it we always it always we will always work it out where where we pay it off at the end of the month so we dont put just a whole lot on there we dont use them just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards because that either youre not financed charged on there and you dont and you dont um you dont need to have cash there and they dont now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit so are you married vocalizednoise yes we are i am and uh weve got some children and uh you know weve just seen the need for well we just moved into a house uh that were renting and thats gonna which will suck up your money real laughterquick yeah yeah it really will so were you know were going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July and uh you know wed go out to eat on Sunday after church or something like that and i think were gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids ,family_finance,4031

i guess my basic feeling is that as a middle income tax payer im not paying too much if im sure that im getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and i dont know laughter im sort of overwhelmed by it all do you think that thats because the uh because the politicians have been seduced by the the opportunity to get the vote uh so theyve spent the money on on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh  uh lets see how shall i say it paying money to people that that uh it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh uh input of money can uh which they can never turn off by the way uh will get this guy votes yeah its entirely possible certainly anything thats been discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation seems to be concerned with just that you know whos whos gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity vocalizednoise there was yeah although oh excuse me i was just going to say theres significantly more money uh and we werent a debtor nation in those days yeah i ive never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs for instance or public improvements and today there there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding of resources by each generation well vocalizednoise i think two things have happened number one its like uh pay play now pay later uh somebodys were were to the point now where  where the pay later is uh is here and  and uh when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and and it just goes by pretty fast well uh the play now pay later uh mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh the the debt load is way up uh you know in the sixties what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right i dont yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly vocalizednoise yeah i mean well im not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh you know perhaps anyway what im saying is that everything costs more these days uh and weve reached a point where where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing thats more important uh progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made you know the daily the minimum wage is  lets see what is it when i was a  im i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i vocalizednoise hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh you know taxes on what what i thought was a very good salary are about the same as they are today only im making ,taxes,4044
okay should begin okay all right i can begin this um basically i work for Honeywell in Minneapolis and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good im im pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical uh you name it and for me this is the first job ive had where theyve covered that much so im pretty satisfied myself um whats your situation i i work for the University of New Hampshire and uh our benefits package isnt uh isnt quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall im satisfied with it we dont have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medical or the dental uh vocalizednoise are you a professor there no i work in im in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i uh effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire oh i see okay uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get oh no doubt laughter we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off right oh thats good yeah thats one of the things i guess i would change about Honeywell is uh i used to work with the Army Research Institute and being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off but here you dont get that you maybe get two or three a year so its really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so thats thats kind of a drawback i think but uh i dont know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits well i think uh the the health care of course is is an important in has to be the single most important benefit and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know im im a little disturbed about that but i think thats a national trend and i dont know that uh i dont know what the solution is to it its bigger than just the benefits part yeah i dont know if you saw on Twenty Twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed Oregons plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing its kind of an interesting plan its kind of cold though theyve essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical medical maladies that you can have and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would oh yeah so its kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you dont youre kind of out of luck but um it vocalizednoise was an interesting show i think youre right i think health care is probably the the most pressing uh the pressing one but ill tell you i i i dont mind having dental you know uh sometimes dental costs can be just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical but im not sure thats thats widely followed any more im not sure how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which i belong to and but the main i think the health the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued oh okay uh for the operating staff its on a seniority its uh you know based on how long theyve worked there uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get yeah im kind of interested because im actually thats the route id like to take when i finally get my degree is to uh is to teach in university im a doctoral student in Florida right now but um yeah thats thats interesting thats one of the things id like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that college programs uh belong to this T I A A uh C R E F uh retirement fund oh is that right right and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh ,job_benefits,4056
all right uh did you uh did you have to wait very long excuse me did you have to wait very long oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number all right so uh they had are Americans still paying too much too many taxes thats a thats an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this yeah i well no laughter i mean yes laughter oh you think you that we are paying too much in taxes yeah yeah i dont think were paying a lot too much i uh i think were paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do yeah its even higher uh tax rate over there on income yeah so i guess we should be grateful that its as low as it is right are are you youre a native youre from uh the United States yes i im from Idaho actually but you worked over there for a couple of year yeah yeah i was so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an impression kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldnt be i shouldnt complain so much i uh i do get concerned that theres that theres a lot of uh government spending on things like um things that that dont really benefit anyone outside of the congressmans district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that right you talking about special projects in the US in the US you mean now okay yeah its true i feel that um you know i dont feel that uh were paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think weve kind of gotten away from that um for what we get were paying too much i would say you wouldnt mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it right or if if things i didnt feel that things were wasted i can go for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh money a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because im single im in a reasonably high tax bracket um it seems very expensive to me for what i get right right typically um you dont get a whole lot laughter no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i dont i dont have a dictator i dont im not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i dont mind spending money on and uh welfare on reasonable amounts of welfare i dont mind spending money on and things like highways and stuff i dont mind spending on well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents Patrick Buchanan has a idea that says that if hes president if you dont get a job within two years then youre taken off welfare so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system you know you you have you get to spend your time but then youre off dont know if i agree with that or not i mean because theres people that just plain i dont know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason although two years that does sound like quite a while i dont know what do you think of that one well i i i guess im not i dont like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because theres always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue um one thing that ive kind of been following that i id really im kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections well see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can see if he can uh give the line item veto a try and uh apparently hes been waiting for a test case hes been waiting for quite a while but i think itd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills thats thats clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that thatd be quite an exciting battle yeah i dont know whats your situation i live uh im a property owner in the city limits of Atlanta and we get taxed tremendously tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesnt go for what the original intent of property taxes was um i pay for a a local hospital uh Grady Hospital where a lot of indigent people are go and get free care and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i i and a lot of other things ,taxes,4057
uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check vocalizednoise since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so thats what i go by well we we try its its not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier but um and then at the end of the year i i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within you know a bounds there and then if theres if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but its not always easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that youre not expecting i dont really know how some people stay within a budget oh yeah i can i can understand that laughter do you have kids vocalizednoise got one kid one we dont have any because i thought if well if we had a laughterchild i dont know what wed do but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then thats when we we try to put some a side at that time as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four O one K panplan in a profit sharing and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan because to me thats the only way were ever going save to be able to save oh yeah i because if the money comes in its spent if its not taken out before i get it yeah i understand that right right now thats just the problem i have and we dont aint been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now oh yeah through nursing school so its kind of laughter got to thats very hard maxed out right now but we try to put a little away every every month you know and plus weve got child care which we got to put in there and everything and we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on yeah they say how old is he hes five hes five they say by the time kids his age are ready to go to college its gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college and its just unbelievable well thats you know i im just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything yeah if you yeah its kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones umhum where is she going uh U T A vocalizednoise uh im sure it is and you know the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff for that because she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that that adds more to the gas budget oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals do what maam has she started doing any of work at the hospitals uh no she goes they have a class there every Tuesday and thats what they do and then shell start during her senior year uh going to the hospital three times a week so yeah because i ive got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an R N and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and and all the things which was an added expense  but it is hard i dont know in in compared to say my mother and father living in a budget was no problem it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but thats in this time and you know i dont know what it is its well its you know my husband lets go play some golf you know something like that or let lets run to the mall with me and and before you know parents didnt do that if they didnt have the money they didnt get it and were not that way yeah yeah i understand thats the same problem we fall into you know you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know be with the kids a little bit during that time and and its hard kind of a family deal and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are vocalizednoise credit card rates are still sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent ,family_finance,4063
 well i definitely think taxes are too high uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many peoples uh income now and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridiculous you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes uh and its so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing well lets see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh yeah maybe in some cases theyre not high enough for instance uh here in my state uh you have a real high sales tax there if i recall yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we dont have an income tax and uh you know we dont have an income tax because uh basically nobody nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we cant properly fund uh education here oh really yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student baside get out of my room easide is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it were were ranked fairly low uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know weve got here in the Seattle area weve got a lot of uh uh high technology industries weve got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there theres you know more money doesnt solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh uh that they really dont fund it they they dont basically fund it very well my my feeling about at least i I dont know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here uh some of the public schools get more funds than the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student but the best private school is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money just doesnt uh doesnt turn out that quality of student and well its cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and its not very efficient um uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things thats happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction meaning teachers salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools went to teachers salaries and books and materials now its only forty five percent and thats really scary to think that uh yeah thats ive ive been hearing that thats uh that thats been going down and uh i dont know what uh what all the reasons are for that yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know were spending a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money and uh were spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here last Saturday and just we just had our primary in Georgia and uh uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he talked and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabinet ,taxes,4070
well Jackie uh on taxes i id guess id have to say that i my opinion is that id do think that Americans are paying too much in taxes uh whats your feeling about that i agree i think taxes are high where you live do you you have a state income tax and a sales tax both um yes uhhuh uh uhhuh yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent and we have uh what we call the five Bs uh vocalizednoise for our taxes booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes vocalizednoise yeah i agree i agree vocalizednoise i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting um well if you do get money back from  like jobs like im still a student so um i only work part time so i i get a check back well thats nice from from taxes but nice to nice to get a refund yeah laughterit laughteris but laughter its not much laughter uhhuh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh were getting value for it uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say theyre going to send some back its like giving yourself a transfusion its like one arm giving the other a transfusion you know what i mean uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because yeah there you go right because uh yeah theres an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh theres a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you yeah i dont know i dont doesnt seem like theyre doing much with it neither i mean theres plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i mean they have nice plans and um but laughter they dont always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i dont what happens with laughterall the money because if their plans dont work you know and the taxes get raised i dont know im not you know really into politics i dont really understand it but thats it its just you know laughter well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend uh its almost like theyll spend as much as the they were were theyre allowed to collect you know um  i theres an interesting proposal thats been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax youd have a certain amount i mean you you take your total salary uh those who made under a certain amount wouldnt have owe any taxes and then thered be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you you know after you uh figure out  you know whos in your family right huh and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know yeah that could be nice laughter i id like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a lot you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and im sure theyll fight it tooth and nail but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans  i mean it doesnt seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes doesnt seem fair to me yeah it isnt theres not much out there thats fair laughterthats for sure laughter laughterhuh ill agree to that right i think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high i i if im not mistaken arent they i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is um no i i have no idea i just twenty percent my dad does laughterit laughterall laughterfor laughterme you just pay it huh laughter laughter i use youre like youre like my daughter whos in in college down in Massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and shes attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and ,taxes,4071
okay so Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have well uh i dont know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh my wife uh has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month right thats thats sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have laughter im single so i guess uh i dont know if thats an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically really dont need to laughter right i dont need to laughter im the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier thats right um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh i kind of i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i im pretty consistent from month to month and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes im pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it well i found that uh you know things as as ive gotten older im in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh you know we we planned out how much were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know will come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount ive got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month ill just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in ive got that much set aside and i guess thats a way of budgeting yeah thats i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium uh medium or longer range i just have a maybe a target amount that ill save for like im probably within a year id like to buy a new car so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and im making every effort to to vocalizednoise put a little bit away and you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for for keeping them on the road too you know weve got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so were on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know im constantly making car payments but i figure thats got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually im saving up for another one besides so you you know its its kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh youre only youre not paying for two at the same time i guess what im saying have you thought about uh leasing well ive thought about it but leasing wouldnt i you know i dont use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so i see but if youre rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that yeah i guess uh you know typically you vocalizednoise if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself yeah youre right um i i have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them you know thats right laughter yeah mines uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had expenses a number of expenses but uh im hoping that most most of them were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year and im hoping ill be have a slow period before i need that again laughter those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know its nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say so that it doesnt uh kill you all in one month right what line of work are you in ,family_finance,4079
hi Ed hello Carolyn do you uh work for a large organization yes i work for North Carolina State University which has about six or seven thousand employees wow what do you do are you im an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science i see and you work for TI and you do im a computer scientist and always concerned about benefits laughter right well i im on the benefits committee here one of about twenty people in the university so thats why i checked that topic oh you are i see uh what do you think peoples concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care i swear thats what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university and i wouldnt be real surprised if thats the case um uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh what you know the the uh uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly oh yeah well weve our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider and the laughter you wouldnt believe the complaints because vocalizednoise you know youre family doctor may not happen to be in the network and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you dont go to a network doctor do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not thats right thats right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didnt require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better when uh with the preferred provider we are with the preferred provider yes wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMOs just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs and it worked to some degree but it didnt work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMOs are are those that have uh you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean its obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they dont want to switch just to come in the HMO so you get the people in the H O they they dont uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh you you have almost as many claims so uh thats thats caused a problem uh have you heard about uh cafeteria the cafeteria plan of benefits yes uh i dont think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs well i dont know i i would id be interested in seeing in learning more about that because uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something laughter well i i dont know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you oh yes no that that that its true thats thats important i agree uh yeah thats true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much laughter medical care laughtermedical laughterinsurance laughteror laughtersomething i dont know laughter laughter i dont know about that laughter youd have youd youd have your office visits covered but thats only a small part of the total yeah im sure but uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldnt care about dental insurance uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldnt you now i dont care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to would you i dont know uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation thats right but that you know people like ,job_benefits,4085
 okay Eric um are you married and do you have a family  uh yes i am to uh both questions okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances uh yeah we do we um  uh basically theres the you know expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet  and uh whats ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what you know what sort of range were gonna generally gonna shoot for  so what do you do  well thats basically what we do um about every every three months or so we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week and so that does help that helps a lot and then um we dont have a lot extra extra for extra spending so its pretty well laughter earmarked laughteryeah all allocated out laughter yeah yeah laughter every every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all all the umhum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check were real short or checks yeah right yeah we found that um its definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses laughter we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh thats true money for things that you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh thought it to be really helpful weve gotten some of our loans paid off early because of this and and stuff like that so well it helps you to focus where your money goes and and im sure you felt the same the same frustration before you got on a budget but yeah laughter youre wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then youre saying my word where did all that money go where does it go thats a lot of money but laughter huh and also we have found that if we write down and and we did this were not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know every paycheck and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see  just what you do spend and and like i say we havent been real consistent with it its we should because it does help yeah the other the other thing that that weve found that that helps if you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit its just to laughteruh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh um so long as it wasnt you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount just stick to that uhhuh that is and then once that was gone well laughter if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh its gone laughter that sounds like a really good idea and it really helpful um have you  developed a savings plan or IRAs or anything like that yet we we havent we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card oh uhhuh uh credit card debt and and all of that and were just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so oh thats good thats a good feeling  yeah i my husband just graduated from the university uh  a year ago so finally laughter finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or a study yeah im actually in the in the master ,family_finance,4090
 oh i guess i started it oh okay bust away so uh where you from just in general oh um New York New York okay im in New Jersey uhhuh vocalizednoise okay so uh i guess were talk about taxes uh so what do you yeah well yeah i know i pay too much you pay too much yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just proportional im im viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage and on the bad years im not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i dont pay below average oh are you like a small business or something or yeah yeah im a consultant oh okay you know so due to the nature of the business it um you know my base line is average and i dont get that back on the other half back isnt it their like vocalizednoise um income averaging or something like that there was that went away a few years ago oh okay laughter and uh you know whatever you call it i suspect that was one of those loop holes for the wealthy they closed laughter but uh i dont know for sure so why why do you think you dont get uh anything enough for your value i mean well i didnt say value um im just saying that proportionally i pay this portion in a large amount oh you a single uh no not at the moment not at laughterpresent uh i know singles pay more than married people yeah yeah yeah and im single i know that and i pay quite a bit higher than a married person well thats where if you dont happen to buy a house or something like that yeah if youre unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesnt and you dont uh make it desirable yeah thats about the only uh tax uh write off you can get these days yeah yeah well unless youre up in the uh mega bucks range well yeah buy a yacht or something laughter but um but i guess they took away that and theyre yelling and screaming about that yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh Washington DC awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something umhum yeah you know so uh you know whats going in has got to be a lot more than going out if it can pay for all that stuff well it depends if its you know a a regressive tax or a progressive tax well im not really talking about um who is putting it in im just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things well no yeah in the middle yeah thats what i meant borrowed time actually could be could be borrowed time its like whats that well you know its just uh you know pass a law print up another billion and uh i dont know i i business as laughterusual uh i dont know uh here in New Jersey we have taxes for just the necessities and i think its uh regressive tax its just as worse im not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean progressive um its its like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you dont really need that extra income to survive you know and so the idea idea behind that is to to you know thats why we we have higher tax rates for people who have higher income right at least supposedly well thats the theory um you know thats what progressive tax regressive tax is you can have a flat flat percentage tax um across the board and even and even tax people for things that they need to live so if you tax you can tax uh you know medicine or food and and yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it working it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and theres a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities im sorry only not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container its not taxed but if you buy it in a can reconcentratedconcentrated uh concentrated then it is taxed so um i dont claim to understand that laughter you know thats um and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and yeah sin taxes hope people will stop yeah but you know we you dont need cigarettes or or um alcohol to live liquor yeah thing is you know you got to look all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people laughter well its to a degree if uh you know if youre addicted its not going to matter but um certainly it it depends i mean here you in New Jersey you pay you pay thirteen percent tax sort of value added tax on your utilities so things you need to heat your home the things that drink your water you tax water laughter its crazy um you know you you see what you its got to go somewhere so you got tax for that every utilitys thirteen thirteen percent you know i um we get a tax here that um what do you call it uh ,taxes,4098
uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because im now in the middle of a job search graduating here and realizing that one of the things thats not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will have some set of benefits where ever shes working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental its something that ive been uh looking for thats true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits uh even though you could you might never have any need for them uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesnt matter that youre single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears and uh laughter its that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me thats amusing laughter yeah yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you cant issue health insurance that doesnt have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and uh drug treatment yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah thats the same thing here even if youre and the result is a lot of people wont provide it at all or over charge even if youre a Mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you laughterknow uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh uh if you if you have a a full gamut of of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company vocalizednoise is willing willing to pay for but that youre simply not interested in and what you rather prefer to do is say dont get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other onell pay for the medical instead its its very much designed towards self only insurance i dont know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are yeah i think that uh a a lot of them are that way they uh they they deal they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness whos the primary carrercarrier and whos the secondary carrier but um uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and its very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month well thats pretty good it is im very pleased uh i think uh very pleased with the benefit package that we have that has uh uh a dental check ups are completely covered um theres a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know go work further on a degree or or get a masters degree of something uh uh course thats something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research so in fact youre saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits and wont take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor youre saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that um one thing i was wondering is something ive noticed that that they dont publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort yeah we dont have that either uh in in some ways i think its it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and and uh advice just by picking up the phone or without having to actually uh you know pay somebody extra ,job_benefits,4100
um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is uh put the data into Quicken i dont know if youre familiar with that yeah ive uh have some friends of mine who use Quicken and uh i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now i ive found that its the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife or ill write a few checks and then well uh not bother to total it and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it vocalizednoise helps with that yeah well i have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally well get behind like you say but uh it doesnt really seem to be too too tight if we remember just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced well how do you handle the the long range or medium range planning on finances uh actually we havent had to yet yet uh uh until just recently i guess weve got a a daughter whos eighteen months and another one on the way so we need to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for yeah well thats pretty good if you can do that i know i have a daughter whos ten and we havent really put much away for her college up to this point but um were to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so were gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that ill be making this summer well be putting away for her college fund sounds good yeah i guess were were just at the point my uh my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now were just going on the one income so its lot more interesting trying to find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way well be able to do it just you know kind of enforce the savings but uh itll be interesting to see well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently took on a full time job well almost full time so its only recently that weve had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and significant travel and that kind of thing that sounds good but uh uh i was just curious what uh part of the country ah Wisconsin how about you um Cincinnati actually i was kind of wondering if theyd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i dont know how many people are uh going to be involved in this but well thats interesting im uh uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another uh a colleague of mine at uh at work got some information over the computer network called internet oh okay yeah thats how i got it as well but uh and he just forwarded that on to me and it sounded like itd be an interesting project to participate in so i yeah itll be interesting to see what they vocalizednoise sent back some Email itd be interesting to see how the data base vocalizednoise well i guess were talking about the experiment and probably try to get back on the topic but uh its hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures i guess you know we could talk about some of the long range goals what other long range goals do you have besides college well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point i guess well have to factor that in if were if were not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now its uh now its reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh its its a real shift from what we had before uh because were ,family_finance,4103
 anyway uh  how about you what do you do with your budget what do i do um at the moment its utter chaos laughter um right now im just uh i i dont really have a budget per se im i uh its called living within your means laughter you know which means at the moment um paying off the Visa bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesnt collapse laughter yeah thats true um but uh no i dont really have a budget at the moment um but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i dont  usually dont exceed that unless i unless the Visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that that then it goes through the moon so yeah that sort of a problem yeah so um whatd you were trying were trying to um so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is not much on that side of it laughter to add to it were trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but so you can afford to get a house yeah wed like to do that some day we have this dream  yes but we dont know how long it will be a dream we were kind of real were really happy that we dont have any debt but were at the same time were real scared about incurring it in this um economy right now so were stepping real careful and trying to see whats the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month so what do you and your husband do were missionaries actually yeah uhhuh are you really and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota and its cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here no kidding and it doesnt get switched very easily once you come home i see so overseas where would you be going Africa Nigeria really how long would you be there about four years were career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year with with what church um were with Wycliffe Bible Translators oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in Costa Mesa as i recall yeah they could very well and there there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was vocalizednoise so um are you uh are you uh active in translation um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step youre kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh came home and got married and we will go back back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators well i always wanted to do translation but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak its easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could youre free to travel anywhere you dont have kids hanging around you and stuff true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but theres im not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did you know complete a survey in one area id switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff but in about um about five i guess i can do better in it and my French is pretty good but its uh Senegalese French so uh im terrified to speak it in um in France in France yeah because theyre real snobby about their language and Senegalese French is street French and i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didnt know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when i came home and French to somebody and he paled and said im not going to tell you what you said so since then i have refrained from speaking any French laughter except in Senegal laughter i dont know what i said to him but uh i didnt ask him either must have been terrible the um was it Henry Macon said that the the uh language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die and i it it just amazes me that the French dont recognize that free style English is just takes on new ,family_finance,4104
 uh guy uh some of my things i id like to have a short work week oh okay you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cause okay we can start off there lets just get started i dont wanna well you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it laughter  okay  so i just press one then right okay ready so so you think uh i i think vocalizednoise a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty seven hour work week how about you well right now im im just a student i only work part time but i ive work in the job force before and forty hours is just too long you just dont have any time to do anything it it seems like Saturday Saturday you you get off but Sunday youre getting ready for Monday and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well thatd happen is that for every four people wed give another job vocalizednoise uhhuh and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market wed have uh more recreation people would have time to do it thered be less of a stress level wed have less wed have less crime wed have to wed have to build less prisons wed need you know less police force yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time its not clear in that it it thats thats thats a thats a possibility one of one of the problems theyre facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance is that the small businesses cant afford cant offer us health insurance and it it its too costly and then what is what is happening is that theyre on um a policy where they have so X amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and and and things like that what happens and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular its called a a group well whatll what happens then is that they cancel because they just cant cancel the indivigalindividual so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people dont have any insurance coverage but im im you know im im satisfied with my job im im an engineering student and i work for my instructor and im im not a typical student im im older im im in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token its a really really enjoyable for me because i dont have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and one of the things that i i really hate about jobs i dont i dont like bosses that that you know wanna yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i i just really cant deal with that so yeah uh what kind of what kind of jobs have you done well i do work uh research in computer science and ive just been doing that for a few years now so i my job has most of the benefits i want um what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as id like but uh you know thats just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of uh they also a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education like i i get night courses that theyre theyll cover right now and thats really good yeah thats great you have what you might call knowledge power you know when when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that youre categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist but if youre a person thats doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system youve revised and revamped the system well then youre youre vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so thats where im that im i like im into computers too and thats one of the things that ive found in in any one one of these jobs and anything ive done is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge youre youre not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway but what i ,job_benefits,4109
 right now im at um University of Pennsylvania im a graduate student and the benefits that i get are very minimal but i do get my health insurance paid for but i dont have any kind of disability insurance or um lets see no disability insurance no vacation well i get in a way i get vacation pay because i get to set totally set my own schedule not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal um im im a coop student at GTRI uh i go to school at Georgia Tech and we dont have benefits to speak of we dont have health insurance or paid vacation and youre undergraduate student or graduate student undergrad yeah yeah here they for the grad students at least in physiology department which my degree degree granting department is biological engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesnt even do that yeah yeah but i dont know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now so that some people can get them and some people cant and its like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not itd be great if they had everybody responsible for their own health insurance and either that or what they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else well thats a good idea i had never thought about it that way i guess i would like to see something like that and then i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having instead of um a national health insurance system having a sort of like an FDIC for health insurers so if if youre health insurance company goes out of business you dont lose everything if you get sick right thats that would be a wonderful idea but on the other hand in in the current state of the current system ill whenever i get out of here ill look for a job probably an academic job that would you know benefits i dont know how important thatll be usually academic jobs you get TIAA for your retirement plan which is a its a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to i didnt know that a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking  good care of you i know my daddy worked for the federal government and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he went taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isnt particularly well she has um shes a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that now that her kidneys have totally failed theyve taken her off one of the drugs Lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture and her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month laughter so and thats the lowest its been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out oh im im just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and uh im not really all too sure what kind of jobs are available and uh i havent gotten them yet im going in a few and i i im going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see uh if research for a school would be something i would consider  hum what kind of company are you working with cooping oh oh its the Georgia Tech Research Institute its affiliated with the university um i see and uh we do research uh the one im in the lab im in does research in microwaves and antennas and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government so a lot of our uh expenses are you know covered by the federal government ,job_benefits,4112
it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high well i think theres a big waste of our tax dollar it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesnt seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar we dont uh we it theres theres too much um pocket stuffing uh going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and do uh projects for the state and you know course they they prove that all the time on over the TV you know yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what what keeps taxes high but i right that uh i just i just pay you you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get ive got a little piece of property i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean ive got five and a half acres its out in the country and if i could get what theyre charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute oh boy you know so that thats why i just dont uh theres a lot of you know a lot of expense as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldnt be spending our money on but uh i im im very uh im a single parent so im very touchy about taking every dad gum dime i make laughter yeah that does make it difficult it does really does are you you are you accountant an accountant or uh well i used to work in finance but i i dont any longer i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours but they may also get better value for the dollar thats the real question right well you know ive i can handle the i can handle the tax money the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that but it you know when you hit all the uh bad roads and uh and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that thats a thats a bigger right thats whats irritating problem to me than than having to pay them  its also irritating that you we keep hearing a lot of lip service about how  how to make it better and how to spend it more wisely but they never to seem to hear that that it changes or improves well i think i think one of our uh and this is really not the total uh thing uh not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our uh the our Federal Government is our uh why in the world they dont get rid of one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the Congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and uh because thats costing thats costing the taxpayer multimillions multimillions and uh but they govern each other and they they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and um i dont ive never understood uh you know why i there is one state what state is in the United States that only has one housing i meant one governing body hm i dont remember hearing that okay there is theres one state ive i in fact i dont know whether its New Hampshire its a northern state or New England state that has one housing body and uh one governing body and um you know they their taxes are are more well spent but uh no ive you know i disagree with a lot of things but um a lot of things i cant change but uh what state what part of the country are you from im from Texas but now i live in California im course im im from Texas too but um i think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here  which counties are that where where do you live i live in uh my i have some my little piece of land is in uh Benedict County and i live in Smith County and what state is that in still in Texas still in Texas you hear this Texas accent laughter yeah i cant get rid of it laughter course in Texas at least you still dont have income tax well i think we pay it in other ways i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways its funny to me too that uh why the government taxes has a tighter higher tax rate for a single person than they do for a married couple ,taxes,4115
 so do you work for an employer who uh gives you health benefits yeah we get um i have i have good health benefits actually oh yeah yeah i have uh all of them and theyre its pretty cheap per month and they i get to pick my own doctor and they have really good benefits uh um do you have any any interesting benefits aside from basic health coverage uh besides basic uh no i have um some a little bit of uh life insurance benefits do uh do you get any kind of dental or optical coverage uh no the the uh no optical the dental is fully covered um except unless its major but anything minor or just checkups thats all covered and uh is your whole family covered or do no thats just me but they can be i have that option but its more money but theyre not they have their own i see so through your husband or oh no me im single its just through me oh i see its its uh so its and it that makes it cheaper too since im single okay do but do you have children no no oh okay so thats real simple yeah here uh yeah laughter its just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a little extra but not much not much not for the good but its really good the benefits are good yeah i think its pretty significant benefit uh really uh makes you wanna stick around laughter yeah yeah they have they uh it does laughter laughteryeah thats just what you want to hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out uh which seems kind of unfair do do you work where you have benefits like that yeah yeah we have we can choose uh a couple different plans they made they try to make it real flexible where if you dont use much you actually get cash back oh really um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO uh well i used to have that when i was single and i was i found it very convenient uh and we have some optical and dental coverage thats i guess its optional but i think we can get one pair of glasses a year yeah the really well thats good thats so yeah its pretty good actually uh i think a anything under a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference uhhuh see thats see i wear glasses not all the time but when i read and stuff and um i wish we had some kind of optical coverage but theres yeah its nice theres none whatsoever and it can get expensive yeah it can uh at least its not like medical where it can really go through the roof you know at least somewhat limited um lets see you have any kind of uh child care benefits or um yeah for the um actually if youre i believe i i read up on some of it if youre pregnant anything in they have really really good coverage they have um like well baby care its its pretty much covered thats a problem sometimes i understand when the babys not sick but you know you have these periodic appointments and especially when theyre younger yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh the appointment even though theres not really one yeah some seems more honest and though and the pregnant mother has uh full coverage for well mother care uhhuh well thats good thats good and do is there any kind of interesting uh what i mean what happens after the babys born is there some uh some maternity leave policy um thats what i was trying to i think there is i dont really remember how long it is but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess and um most of the benefits are pretty good the hospital benefits and and they let you pick your own doctor you have your choice actually if um its better they give you a list and if and if your doctors on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company i see so they theyre preferred providers or is that a yeah but you can have your own doctor right and you pay a little more or certain things arent as well covered but at least you have that option yeah umhum thats nice because once in a while you find someone who deals specifically with you know what you have or or somebody just somebody youve dealt with already a yeah and and a lot of times because we just switched my company my uh company just switched insurance companies and before  we did not have that choice ,job_benefits,4122
okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway well i i do take care of pretty much laughterall of the stuff for for my wife and for me and um i embarrassed to say its pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year umhum do you use a computer no i work with them all day yeah im in computer science yet i i do everything on paper laughter uh i dont even use a calculator for the stuff im doing because its all pretty round numbers yeah mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when um he was a Marine he went to Saudi Arabia and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance you know so they come in i pay them and thats it laughteryou laughterknow thats about the extent of it you know yeah i i dont really have this major budget or anything i just really im real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know what little we have laughter so thats what i do yeah its a pretty its almost i cant imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets it seems like if youre getting to that level youre youre not in real good control you know i mean i i ive never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know you buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done you know so actually im i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way its a record of everything and i dont have to worry about keeping laughterrecords of anything else because they come in at the end of the month i dont have too many weaknesses i dont have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them you know its so much easy easier you know if somethings on sale if youre a woman and youre a sale person its like oh well thats on sale lets go grab it you know laughter so um and if you dont have the money then use the credit card so i got rid of them credit cards yeah i guess if thats you know if thats a weakness thats a good thing to do yeah that was my weakness it wasnt bad i mean i didnt have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just learned that that wasnt for me you know but i self employed you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or no its not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what ive made and um you know what its gonna have to go for that month and you know its not that not that hard not at all well thats good to know i always do my own income tax you know do you i dont understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it it seems like its absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it read all you got to do is read a book i mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to yeah just the form yeah yeah and a lot of them its dumb laughteryou laughterknow i guess if you had some really complicated stuff but i dont so i dont mess with it but i dont use a calculator either laughteryou laughterknow i dont i dont have that much that many you know things to add up so i dont trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure that that i i keep on top of the numbers and understand whats going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they werent paying attention oh yeah and we have a i i bank at NCNB here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in like once every other week or so and i will um check off what checks have cleared and do you do that yeah we have the same thing you do too and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have you know i do that real often i do that so ,family_finance,4127
 think about uh taxes well i think theyre a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh you spend what you have and you you dont spend more than you than you bring in yeah i think that the general idea is to spend you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but theyre running under the assumption you know the way theyre running it now theyre have you know running it under a deficit spending you know while were not under a recession so theres never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that were running so thats kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt youre not going to payoff what you owe so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay for you know get what you pay for well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living yeah vocalizednoise theres laughterso i think for for for many years uh weve paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh we have not paid them really what theyre worth in what they contribute to society i agree with that but uh then again uh its the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments i guess im a im a student right now and i dont make a whole lot of money and so i i kind of dont pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored i go to a state sponsored school and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess im kind of in debt i i suppose because i dont you know been paying taxes all that all that long my parents i guess however however however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back i will this year anyway from uh youre very fortunate laughter we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount uh laughteryeah laughteri laughteram i need it too otherwise things we dont regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money  and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay more taxes you pay it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount uhhuh isnt uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the nineteen ninety ninety one whatever nineteen ninety one uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though theres uh taxes on different things but you know theres federal theres a lot of taxes you pay that youre not even aware of that youre paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax well isnt uhhuh theres a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank the taxes that people dont think about that yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes there was that which candidates was it Jerry Brown one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a flat i think a flat percentage something like that if you implemented implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say heres my break point im not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs exactly thats because up until like eight and so based on that who do you think youre talking to youre talking to an employer up until like eighty five or something was ,taxes,4138
so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all yeah actually actually uh mines real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on and uh thats usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because i get a couple thousand dollars back usually oh thats nice but uh actually i uh i dont really begrudge uh the uh the government their due i do i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know theres a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes and i dont think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them to the people laughterwho really need them laughter but uh generally i think theyre pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didnt have taxation laughterso right i dont have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i dont know if theyre unfair theyre confusing and i there seems to be ability to get those all together yeah we actually we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for laughter and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadnt been made and all that kind of stuff and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of you just bought it right square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and just just showed that you know our obvious for some reason our property had been valued much higher and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the appraisal really they didnt raise the they canceled your neighbors taxes uh they didnt raise my neighbors laughteryeah they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal thats really great so i you you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh thats wonderful yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of mad at the world and laughteruh laughterhe he had sort of that that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadnt been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff that just didnt impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean right and you just bought yours thats the best argument i think yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty satisfying satisfying laughter experience laughter thats wonderful but it was it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like i bet oh it was a it was a it was like a judges chambers that that you really wow it wasnt it wasnt the county council it was the it was the county but it wasnt the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i dont know i dont even know how they get on it you know i im just guessing theyre appointed uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here laughterso you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time itd be him laughteryou right well he did he probably knows it really well the real estate market so that was probably help but other than that uh i havent had too much too much problem with taxes actually when i was in grad school i lived in Virginia also i went to school down at uh Charlottesville and uh uh i had a you know one of these graduate fellowships and fortunately it was not taxable at that time right now it is but they actually they actually hassled me over it though and i had to i had to go to some length you know i actually got one of these letters that that said you know you got to show up at the local you know IRS office and explain oh you got audited wow yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and you know laughter i just i said hey i mean its tax free i mean thats my understanding of things so anyway eventually they they accepted that that it was but actually work i work with a guy now whos i I i guess he was right ,taxes,4142
 Wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh let me ask you the question do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to  right now im in college and im on work study and so my budget comes from my dads help laughterhe helps me out a lot and i get paid monthly so thats kind of hard to have a budget my mother uh doesnt get paid much money so her budget is um  just uh planning for IRAs i see i see well good im im kind of in a different situation but i i i went through that too when i was in school but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that but uh im married and have uh a couple of children and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget im on a salary so i dont get any overtime or anything like that so  oh but we have a fixed income and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have is is spent accordingly and um what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment we have the insurance premiums um utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know were going to spend and set that money aside and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the college the kids education college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds and and we also set aside an emergency fund because that sounds good weve uh laughter weve been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on theres always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh its not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for and uh then we have you know whatevers left over is disposable income disposable disposable yeah discretionary income laughter that we use for the rest of the month so and its worked out very well its uh its helped us so that we havent been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that and nice thing about it i uh my wife is well thats good is excellent in that we both work together we both have a budget and we stick to it and theres no surprises in that laughter well good laughter with two kids that could be hard well actually i have four kids so laughter yeah i said a couple of kids i i guess i should have specified i have four oh my goodness four little boys yeah four boys oh my goodness its just me and my sister you bet you bet all right laughter and my parents divorced three years ago and my sister had gotten through college but i was still in high school and my mother paid for a lot of my sisters college while my parents were together and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college but uh when we had the divorce she just didnt get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house so now my dads paying for all of my college laughter and financial aid and scholarships im a music major so i have auditions coming up well good good yes well what year are you in college im a sophomore youre a sophomore so you have a few more years  right right ill ill probably have about two two and a half years left uhhuh well good for you good for you yeah i imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during uh during school and so forth oh it sure is i i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks and i and i dont spend over laughterthat yes laughter well great great and sometimes thats a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff youve got to work on too oh sure theres theres always music books to buy lab fees laughter oh yes oh yes well youre not a starving artist yet are you oh no no no i dont plan on being a starving artist laughter thats why im in college laughter vocalizednoise well good there theres enough of those in the world huh  right laughter good good im glad to hear that Wendy well thats usually because theyre not real educated they cant afford to  have a really good job whos whos not very well educated the starving ones theres enough out there that if you have if youre educated enough then you can make money oh yes yes thats true thats true ive found that out so thats why im planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside right what did you major in i majored in business administration well good you know plenty about planning a budget a budget and um yeah but uh once again ,family_finance,4149
 um whats our topic taxes do we pay too much right um well do we  what do you do i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket youre in my tax bracket is is pretty high up there i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket and uh i think that were paying too much because i dont have any children and i pay a lot on property taxes um sure i dont have any um i dont you know i dont use an awful lot of city services it it you know  its like i have to work but uh i have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes and um you theres so many people who wanted a dibbit of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is and i just sometimes many times i end up feeling like im paying too much in taxes how about you do you pay too much uh well no i cant really complain im a student um and i vocalizednoise i work as a coop at uh Georgia Tech Research Institute and uh im gonna get back most of what i earned i mean most of what i pay in taxes and uh and uh one one of my parents is still claiming me hm well when you when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world it it it changes quickly um you look at your paycheck and you go oh my gosh where did it all go laughter im sure laughter um what kind of what kind of uh well have you paid a lot of in taxes have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you did you go directly from high school into into college i went uh well i did work um just various jobs for some time but i i didnt make enough money to really make too much of a difference right to worry about it have you have you been active in in politics trying to  concerning this have you like worked on a political action committees or something like that no no i havent i uh i havent done any of that type of work myself um but every once in a while when i hear up here at at um in DC area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress um  Congress has added too towards a Members Bank there you know theres a bank that they all bank with and i guess it went defunct recently and one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years almost about a thousand bad checks and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule and um its causing quite a stir up here because were so close to DC anyway its really kind of curious to watch this thing occur oh sure um i i i think we pay too much and ive i look at my paycheck and i make well lets see they take out in state and federal taxes i think i pay forty two percent forty two cents out of every dollar i make goes to the government and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes and they charge me all these others and its just too expensive i cant believe that i im just thankful that i dont get all the government that i pay for you know what i mean do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government no no i havent uh i uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition so uh im i havent made use of that what are you studying down there physics ooh that sounds like a fun fun field  laughter laughtereverybody says that laughter scientific laughter heavy science are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that or is it more um applied physics um i havent i havent gotten too terribly much into my major yet actually um  the the degree im getting is physics theres a different one for applied physics so i guess you could call it more straight stuff okay well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia thats vocalizednoise rolling towards whatever its rolling toward than applied i doubt about that are are is America i mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries actually i dont think we are nah i dont think so either um like like Europe um England i know the taxes are a lot higher but they do have socialized medicine and things like that and um i know that i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um theyre talking or maybe it was on the radio ,taxes,4155
so uh do you keep a monthly budget or anything like that oh yeah i im one of those people who keep a record of everything laughter so you you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card and all the A T M transactions and everything and ive got a file for each of them and how do you categorize these things thats what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh i i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for okay um so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid unless i get paid on time like like for instance if a bill is due on March fourth ill just ill put it in the folder with March and that way when i get paid in March i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uhhuh go ahead right and that and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not okay and uh what happens then when you dont when i dont what have extra money laughter laughter then i dont do anything laughter ive got two little boys oh okay oh uhhuh so im at home most of the time anyways but like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my kids for the day and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but its something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids because youre always got to have money when you have laughterkids oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey im willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on well i have a i have a running budget for every month clothing or and on that budget i type up a budget for every month in the year and it has the bills that i know i have every month electric phone food the kids pediatrician uhhuh uhhuh uh my Visa bill you you know all the bills i know i have every month are on that budget and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if theres not then i know that money the rest of the money is mine so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on oh yes groceries that you expect to spend for each month okay and things like um now some some expenses come up you know twice a year or once a year like insurance right or well that comes up every six months for me or like tags come up once a year and youve got to figure that in too so you have an entry for each month for those things right whenever my tags come up uh there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so im expecting it and and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck uh is in that month because after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month i could pay with that hundred and fifty dollars and then whats vocalizednoise left i can do what what i want with uhhuh so now what about the uh long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff well ive got an annuity fund set up because i dont know uh just the way i was raised i look toward the future not only for my kids but for myself and ive got an annuity for me and every two months i buy my boys each a savings bond every since they have been born ive been doing that that sounds great um so now what exactly in an annuity ive always found those a little confusing an annuity is an account its like a uh its its a type of savings account okay but you dont touch it you just deposit money into it but you dont touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement okay now do you pay taxes on the interest not right now okay only when you draw it out and like if elderly people they have a choice of having an IRA account and they get special discounts on like the um whats the word im trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an IRA they get special rates on it and stuff  you mean from the you mean from taxes or from from the federal government you mean uhhuh right for the elderly people and stuff that have IRAs set up and they get special discounts on that but an an annuity is its a savings account that you dont withdraw anything out of you just keep depositing money into it okay now i guess the question is is it better than an ,family_finance,4156
so do you keep a family budget well not a real strict one but we do work hard at saving for the future and do that primarily through uh payroll reduction at my employment thats a good way to do it what what we usually do my wife and i fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and i i dont um so what what happens is uh i make the money and she spends it but she spends it carefully and then at the end of the month she just tallies it up and uh we have basically categories spend this much in this area this much in that area and uh although i dont keep that in mind as we spend we do um kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did and uh you know at the beginning of the month too we also take out some some savings and put them aside so we we know we dont have that to spend that appears to work pretty well i actually use a computer to keep track of our family uh expenses i enter all the all the checks that we write and most of the cash that we spend and all the credit card transactions into a computer program that and keeps track of where all of our expenses go and every few months i look at that to get an overall idea of of uh how our expenses compare to my income and make sure that were not getting a beyond uh what we should be spending in any particular area and try and figure out for the for the year whether were going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time  do you have a uh specialized program or do you or do you just use something like a spreadsheet uh its a specialized personal finance program and it seems to seems to work real well weve got uh a couple of those but uh ive been trying to get get my wife sold on a spreadsheet and have her uh doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by hand um she says as long as shes dealing with the numbers and its just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says its just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic yeah i think i think generally people do find that that probably is just as quick to keep by hand the only question is whether whether the additional reports and the uh you know the the nice record keeping that it gives you is worth a little bit of extra time well thats kind of the way i feel and uh i use spreadsheets a lot and a lot more than she does so i feel like shes you know if if she did do it for a couple months shed probably like it but she was just that do you have any uh any particular ways that that feeds into your longterm uh savings or retirement plan um our as far as our family budget goes yeah what we do is we kind of know what what were making and weve been doing keeping track long enough that we know what we need to spend and pretty much all the difference uh well it goes into two or three different places what have what we call an education account where we put aside some money for each of our children every month laughter with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it its not going to be enough anyway have have you and uh then we have kind of just a savings account and and right now all weve been doing is taking that and and putting it away in a money market account we havent been investing or anything like that uh yet we just moved last year into a home just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of substantial other commitments to take care of right now but makes it difficult yeah we uh you know we even with all that were still able to put some aside how about you well i contribute as much as i can to our four O one K plan at work and we also have a a uh company stock purchase plan which i contribute to and between those two thats thats pretty much all that were able to save but fortunately those are fairly substantial and i feel like thats at this point the uh the the most important part of our longterm uh savings plans and then hoping the hoping if i get a few raises that ill laughter be able to get beyond that but right now thats all im able to save well its its nice to have something you know people say that if youre if youre not saving money youre spending more than you earn and uh thats probably the case you know you never can live down to the last dime so youre either coming out ahead or coming out behind i know were just getting started on our family so ,family_finance,4160
so you keep a budget  uh not really all i i just have one commitment and that is that at the end of the month that uh that everything is paid and thats basically my budget thats your budget eh so we use credit cards and uh lets see what else and when i get a when i get a uh a bill in the mail i write a check out for it immediately put a date on the outside of the envelope stick it in my little Franklin Planner and uh i carry it around and then on the day that im supposed to mail it why mail it and that way i know how much im in the hole so basically  my budget is uh based on  if uh the bank accounts low why we dont spend very much  my uh wife and i were new young couple starting out so weve been trying to  budget its getting a lot a lot tighter and weve actually worked out a very extensive year long budget oh wow so we know exactly what were gonna spend when and when were gonna have money and weve worked out a cash flow we just bought a house which is another reason why were really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff oh yeah laughter and so we have this detailed budget and in some ways its really kind of nice because theres not much of a worry or not much a discussion or any real conflict over whether we should do this or that or we always have a theres a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know that were going to have money to do what we said were going to do now you have a consensus yeah we as my brother told me when he hes in accounting and he suggested we do this as we were ahead of time huh making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he said well you just do this and you fight once and and thats it once a year and thats it because youve worked out the budget and what youre going to spend ah thats very good ive im uh i i tried that in the beginning and when when when i say tried it i we tried to sit down there was no consensus uh we both agreed  that uh how shall i say it was the best consensus we could get was uh were both are pretty thrifty and and uh  you know it just well just watch our we just wont spend money uh big items well  kind of talk to each other about but we have two  were playing uh Russian Roulette i guess although weve been married uh how many years now uh lets see twenty six twenty seven years now doesnt sound sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out thats gonna work just fine well its it what it is its just a kind of a commitment not to spend too much and uh  so the uh but the uh the budget idea sounds pretty good i think if if if we ever had one of these financial crisis you know like a oh an an emergency of some kind a job uh loss or something like that wed have to  wed have to do that but neither one of us  are predicting what what i do with her is i we have two bank accounts one i i wanted to uh i wanted her to uh to learn how to balance her checkbook because shes she just  the the best she can do is is keep it uh current so to speak so what i did was i gave her another checkbook and i said okay you uh this is your account you can have money anytime you want it just tell me how much is in your account laughter she said no you are trying to control me i said im not you know you can have six hundred dollars in there if you want another three hundred just tell me and uh so finally we got we have one of these uh things where we get money the company puts makes a direct deposit  so i give her lets see what  she gets uh like a third of the money for the household and i pay everything else yeah what weve done see weve only been married three years and i my wife isnt real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything and then i come in and help her i think thats good and uh thats been really good because its you know weve both come to appreciate and understand whats going on and she does most everything now and its really quite nice actually laughter and uh i i think thats good one one of my uh friends suggested that that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do do that because ,family_finance,4161
it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent um they arent as as responsive both to like bad economic times you dont have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean yeah yeah see i work for a really small company its just me and my boss laughter oh wow so its really small and i think its really nice because you know its its real easy we dont really have much to do but its just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or you know it just goes straight from me to him and we dont have to go through a bunch of people like youre saying but but sometimes its kind of bad because if im sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless im you know have to stay in bed because im the only one there yeah there is that i mean well and then i guess again i i guess like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i dont show up for for work theres probably somebody else that could fill my spot but um i imagine and and thats nice but uh its would its also nice to be able to uh know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if youre not there it doesnt happen yeah and also also in big companies they have uh like vacations and all no if i take a vacation ive got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week oh wow oh wow yeah so laughter so its pretty nice being able to take off and have someone else take your take up your time and all you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didnt take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in  sometimes big companies will pay for like education oh yeah yeah i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing you know but uh a friend of mine works for a a stockbroker and um its a really its a big company and they said that um as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses theyll reimburse her so thats pretty nice so that she could move up in the company and thats pretty nice my job wont do that laughter yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people of course i guess if theres only the two of you youll i mean i guess youre youre one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for things like uh like if if theres some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids yeah thats  bigger companies might have something like that yeah that would be nice and uh um  like like its their i guess another advantage might be that uh if they if its big a big enough company and it has multiple sites um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country yeah they moved uh my dad worked for im not even sure where but they moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas so laughter we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all i mean i guess its nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever vocalizednoise which i guess i being with a small company you wouldnt get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because you know we werent just living in Dallas and didnt exactly know just everything about Dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so oh you had family in San Antonio no we had family in Dallas and we moved to San Antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in Oklahoma and Louisiana so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different  see im trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company laughter a number of people but uh although its getting smaller every every day um and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least and like i dont know i mean theres well theres i ive kept in touch with some people from college but but i dont i mean i dont really know i cant i wouldnt i couldnt vocalizednoise ,job_benefits,4163
so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm well its about three hundred and fifty people i guess thats not large compared to some but its big enough  and they have a they dont have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and i wish they did you know they have a K but i put all the money into it they dont add anything what about you uh i work for a fairly large company its got eight thousand people and uh we do have health insurance and we dont have OK K plan stuff like that but we do have like retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then  the rest is whatever you want to put in if you want to put more than that or something like that oh thats a pretty good deal  thats not bad now how long does it take for your contribution to vest God i dont know laughter its probably a long time laughter im sure its not till like twenty five years thirty years yeah the place i work at is health insurance is kind of expensive its like you know hundred bucks a a month or something for a family huh well i guess what we have is like a flex what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh  guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use it or lose it and that doesnt get taxed or you can just have that money you know put in your paycheck yeah we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh theyll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses i can send in a uh can send in a request for payment and theyll uh and theyll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld thats pretty good you know its uh it saves a third off on taxes or something yeah well it depends on which company you work for i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan D laughter deductibles are really high its like fifteen hundred dollars but if you go for the other ones youre paying too much money for them because its unlikely if youre fairly relatively uh healthy then its really unlikely that youre gonna use that much amount of money you know so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss whatever whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual laughter  yeah i guess uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan and uh one of my kids was in a car accident and and i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is  really you mean not even your douryour your car insurance  well it it vocalizednoise got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here and and i had a high deductible on the  on the uh on the car car insurance and then vocalizednoise you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and  oh thats too bad laughter blew it laughter oh well yeah uh well i dont know i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh  time off would be nice i only get two weeks yeah yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every every year they give you an extra day until youve got four weeks oh thats nice we dont get them till till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week thats a long time yeah its uh yeah especially in the kind of engineering job im in you know companies dont stay afloat that long laughter and and they  uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used it used to be much more stable its a lot less stable than it used to be they used to have job security and crap but now they dont so you work for Bell or something like that yeah its the Bell Corps which is uh right right yeah so i dont know its its uh no longer laughter so thats what i think its still based on the old model of  and and now they dont uh a lifelong job security telephone pioneers of America all that stuff huh yeah but the the no no longer laughter i dont think so uh hearing a lot theres always theyre always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security oh does is it i mean does it they must have pretty good severance though huh ah i dont know we dont we havent been doing layoffs weve been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management and uh i dont know what they do for those people i mean the the the management they get rid of some of it yeah theres too many managers too many chiefs and not enough Indians but oh they they put ,job_benefits,4171
 so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or about right or well it it its the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and to some extent there is definitely you know you can say all right im paying this money for this and this is what im getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if its actually there when we actually end up retiring laughter laughteryeah its hard to tell there there seems to be some problem you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not what i dont like about the taxes is i was looking through the IRS forms like uh the other day i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt now is that the debt vocalizednoise or is that just the interest on the debt that that is the interest on the debt yes vocalizednoise you know i really dont understand this completely ive always been a little mystified who who are we paying it to um to a large extent i mean one of the i think im not sure if its the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations okay so its to private individuals who own government instruments of some sort well not not just private but theres you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons that are holding that but okay so but these are nongovernmental entities yeah nongovernmental okay who are holding bonds and whatever yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean whats to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if youre just servicing the debt youre not really making any progress right right well its actually uh you also looking at the same form they had that we are borrowing the US is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of how how of whatever its spending every year so were increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the annual budget yeah so were borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what were paying out is going to pay the eighteen the uh debt so to some extent were borrowing money to pay you know fourteen percent that were borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt which is only increasing yeah so were you know net were doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then were doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt right and uh then the question i mean do other countries do this or is this a distinctly American phenomenon that i dont know i dont know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand its only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so you know except for wartimes that the U S has had a peacetime debt well and i guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt and they just seemed like its a good idea why stop laughter yeah i i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down after World War Two it never dropped back down or it was vocalizednoise World War Two or uh Korea i think it never dropped back down so what do you think is the uh you know if you were in charge what would you what parts would you change to fix this problem well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have to have a year to year balanced budget so at least we wouldnt have that additional uh what was it eighteen percent or yeah yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy you know thats i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i very quickly get in trouble with creditors well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesnt it um yeah well thats you know the post wartime Germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so thats one danger but you know its that thats a very large chunk of the money we pay in for taxes each year it is shocking but apparently no ones willing to oh im not no one but by the time it all ends up in Congress seems ,taxes,4180
i dont think anybody pays too little laughterno i would tend to agree very highly i think that were all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it do you get hit up for local taxes there yeah we sure do here in Indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it oh so you you you get the whole smorgasbord thats laughterright we well i i actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die uhhuh right which is probably pretty nice but ill bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high no actually theres no sales tax in New Hampshire either theres laughterno laughtersales tax either no what there is is very high property taxes because thats how they fund schools and everything the only problem is i work in Massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there yep but it well you know we its its only a state taxes no local weve got a five percent sales tax  right but um the problem is that so im paying state tax even though i dont live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they dont tax me so thats not too bad no i uh i really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes and i dont feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i dont utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that that im just getting overtaxed yeah oh i i i mean i id consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun vocalizednoise laughterno thats thats not any fun right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for FICA which is taxes where you vocalizednoise most people forget about them because youve got you know you cant always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA im paying forty percent tax yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste yeah well i i mean i think theres some people there you there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need you know you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program than youre gonna get out of private individuals but you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or thats right got to keep those farmers happy you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although theyre providing necessary services have too much fat in them right there is there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that laughterbureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs you know like we we yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals and you know then you look at how well theyre managed you know i dont think were getting our moneys work out worth out of there i think its all going into into bureaucrats laughterand a lot of its feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean im really thinking a lot laughterabout this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when youve got the Bush administration who has increased government and expenditures uh beyond beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly well between between between him and Reagan yeah laughterright right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters im not exactly sure of our national debt the great communicator are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are supposedly supposedly fiscally conservative oh oh yeah they think oh yeah and then they go and say and that Congress Congress theyre the fault for it but you know the other thing is its tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right lets cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know its like you know its very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if those if people lose their jobs then they become a load and theyre not contributing taxes thats right so you know its its very hard to say you know this is what we should cut yeah its really that is the especially that defense vocalizednoise cuts in the defense is really a catch double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well thats great thats gonna lower our national expenditures but then youre gonna have people on welfare and theyre not putting taxes in who who arent contributing right yeah so thats thats really and uh in our its im glad im not the one who has to come up with these laughterpolicies but whats very funny is in our town meeting they were voting this this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution  for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they dont use thats right ,taxes,4181
 i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up um id started back to school and had all these grand plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on and got it all set up and then kind of got it tuned to it and for about a year or so i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were i dont think ive looked at that thing in a year and a half uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our family uh it we have considered it from time to time and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it because to me the need for a budget is especially when moneys tight and im happy to say that moneys not too tight we just kind of drift along uh weve gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years were all of a sudden uh its IRS time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money but weve even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it how does it pay off for you well by seeing the flow and stuff like that i can see where theres a lot of uh frivolous frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things its hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them all and tape them on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails youre biting off youll be amazed and uh man that that ended it in about a week um  and the same thing for the budget huh yeah very similar procedure interesting i i just got a lecture today from my mother about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness im not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think im ready to elect you to Congress uh uh in terms of actually considering a budget and staying with it really that has got to be one of the worst problems weve got here today and its hardly considered you know here it is uh a an election election year and you hardly hear anything about it right right especially the deficit this massive looming black cloud waiting to break out on us and so i think we as a society tend to have uh at least now kind of uh well budget who needs a budget i mean were having fun yeah yep and so i guess im kind of midway between the the party party party side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every last cent actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of February uh and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating um yep uh i it was called subsist on peanut butter and jelly for the the month and at one point some girls in a sorority that i knew uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me and took me in the back room and fed me a salad yeah colleges and education in many ways you bet you bet i think the reason why they did it was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of laughter disease like that i havent resorted to um peanut butter but i have had to go to long periods of ragu and um pasta well at least youre not down to cat food ooh ooh actually weve got a stash of that we had a cat but it ran away oh no um so weve got a good bit weve got a dog now and itll eat the cat food though thats its treat at the end of the day sounds like a dog with a complex well hes a puppy i dont think he really knows knows too much of uh the difference yet uh great its good food fortunately thats cheap and it fits in the budget twenty five cents a can yeah right right well as long as youre not teaching him how to meow or something like that well ive been trying to teach him to sing lately yeah thats uh it hasnt been real successful but he barks real well oh really uh reminds reminds me of that old adage never teach a pig to sing the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig uh uh ,family_finance,4194
okay you first all right um laughter well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we dont see the sort of feedback that we need from it  laughter um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldnt be spending it on um i dont think that its effectively used yeah i i agree i dont think its uh effectively used um as far as the amount um im never really sure about the amount because theres so much that needs to happen in this country that isnt happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which its accomplished but theres a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily umhum right and uh i i agree with you that things are just not used effectively yeah i think i think and we you know people dont want to live within their means weve got huge deficits that doesnt appear to you know nobodys talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all right right and i was amazed in the State of the Union address and Bush i dont think mentioned the D word once the whole time it was amazing and it kept he keeps coming with these spending plans and im like okay where is the money coming from exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know its okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they dont realize that once they create these programs you well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like uh yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh right vocalizednoise killed you know even when and you know i dont know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um im kind of a states right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation yeah yeah um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so yeah yeah and round most of those are state administered arent they um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um why you know why doesnt the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on right right right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about states like Mississippi and Louisiana that always tend to have and Arkansas and Arkansas significantly with Clinton running but it states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean Louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but still their economy never really got off the ground and you know it it i dont know i dont live in Louisiana or any of those states and i dont ever think that i will but so its really none of my business but its like something you know i i its i dont know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world its just pre elitist but you know the the rest of us in the country at least yes oh yeah i agree exactly um and then i yeah i know theres plenty of people in California here who dont have enough education either i mean you know thats always the a major political football problem in any state the education system oh yeah yeah i well i think were seeing a major decline um but um im im not sure how that relates directly to taxation um yeah thats true thats true uh trying to stay on the topic here laughter yeah well i dont think it really matters anyway because it you know theyll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isnt really it it isnt taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that vocalizednoise people people dont have an idea that the whole were all in this together and in the eighties that wasnt the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of ,taxes,4197
oh i just want to know do tax payers get what they get back what they what they uh put into i kind of doubt it because of because of the latest check writing scandal laughter laughter i should have such good uh such such good use of of the public fund uh i dont know what do you think well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up and  seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i dont quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency well it sort of i i thinking more like the purest principle being at work you know managers such as manager managers in particularly managers bureaucracies exist to uh seek seek to multiply subordinates and not rivals well i think one of the problem is again isnt really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect further removed cause and effect get the the uh more problems you have i remember an incident um back when i was in Dallas where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh i dont remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that that they they wouldnt really have to pay for them i think theyd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it um tremendous deficit anyway uh yeah i i dont know i i uh i rather think were not going to see the end of the deficit for some time although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall im not sure theyre theyre kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now uh running against Washington so thats so we have the outsiders doing the insiders bid you know trying to get themselves reelected i was just thinking thats kind of strange i dont think theyre going to i dont think i dont know how many of them are going to get reelected that way especially after they after all three hundred fifty two or how ever many names got published officially you know we had Robert K Dornam whos been a gap fly of a lot of uh hes hes been uh uh Orange Countys um uh laughter i dont know i embarrassment i guess hes hes really terrible they um never voted down a a weapons package ever and uh he he went out and and uh said claimed that that vocalizednoise that one check that he he uh he he wrote that bounced was to get a uh to get a something like a statue of a Madonna for his for laughterhis for his backyard or something ridiculous like that it was it was pretty funny well i think its easy to you know once you get in the position of power its easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying yeah yeah i very much so um you know its hard to be ethical i think that must be why we see so many that i mean its hard to be ethical when you are a powerful person is what i meant to say that may be why we see so many corrupt officials do you think its because other people because people are spending other people money they got uh no i just think its because power corrupt absolutely ,taxes,4198
 Jeff what do you think are you paying to much in taxes i certainly think that in some cases i am but uh i think its mostly on the federal area were i dont see as much maybe for for my money as uh i might uh i thought of school taxes as well and i was very involved in schools uh in the local community a couple years ago and it was pretty easy to see where it went all there but i guess i have the same opinion that some American have that uh uh its all fat laughter how about you well i i im one of those that im kind of glad i dont get all the government i pay for i tell me more i dont understand laughter well i just ship off so much money to the federal government and if they really uh took it and and did things to govern me well that would be a lot more government than what i think i laughterneed laughter uh oh uh the one i guess that on a daily basis the one that bother me is the sale tax im paying eight and a quarter percent on sale tax yeah that that adds up yeah and and you know you you put put your money down on the counter thinking that is enough to pay for it then you need another dollar laughterbecause you had not guess right on the sale laughtertax it certainly adds up quickly yes and ive heard it said that of course that effect that effect us across the board in terms of social economic uh areas everybody pays that sale tax oh yes um i guess thats i i guess im luck here i only pay five percent that that sound great to me laughter laughter well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another laughter yeah i suppose so yeah there there has been a lot of going on in Texas in term of financing schools uh there some judge decide that we had to have pay equal amount to students i mean you know education dollars per student all across the state well as you know its very large state and it certainly cost more in in some areas than it does in others exactly they uh laughter and  the they they call it the robin hood plan plan taking from the from the mostly prosperous urban district or suburb district and passing it alone to the rural districts so i dont know that thats going to be in the courts for a long time i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for laughter huh well that thats about the attitude here is just that you know if if youre paying for your local tax youre paying your local school district you can see some results of it but its if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something you it its almost like i dont know socialism or something isnt it exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically equal well base upon their income to im sorry i i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh to support doing thing like that and thats probably okay uh its kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i dont have any kids in school ive been retried for thirty five years and im still paying for somebody education i know huh i i guess im a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time ill hate to have to ante up before they got here yes its true laughter thats true do you have income tax and vocalizednoise yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect its not quite a higher percentage as you may pay we dont have a state income tax yet well laughter huh its coming its its on its way i im almost certain uh but thats why we have that eight and a quarter percent sales tax i i certainly thats true and and you know the the damage ,taxes,4209
well Jim sounds like youre starting out on something new uh what kind of uh aspect do you have as for as budgeting well were were actually saving you know both for the wedding and for a house right now so its kind of a double whammy uh where i i stood out uh i been few i uh bachelor for a long time so you know i was kind of living for the the day and vocalizednoise what a debt so the last year or so ive been killing off a lot of debt and actually and uh in May when the stock plan im in comes due im going to wipe out the last of my debt im going to be totally out of debt in we have a nice uh start toward a house um and we we come from a very different background where i came from a fairly affluent middle class family and my fiance came from a lower class uh save every penny youve got laughterfamily so weve kind of i taught her to to let go a little bit more and she taught me to do budgeting and you know really evaluate what kind of stuff were doing well thats good  i guess our situation uh well weve been married twenty years and i guess our budgeting is its actually minimum and weve gone through period where weve needed to budget on quite formally but uh weve gotten to where we structure a lot of our thing so that they uh use use a automatic debit with our banking account  yeah i i use to do that but um i found that it it doesnt give you the flexibility floating something a couple of days when you need to right yeah i guess um you know the situation im in um my pay is vocalizednoise given at a particular period of time and it never varies and you know so theres something that weve just found that it works best to deal with the you know the the regular fixed expenses uh yeah i i suppose when when youve got you you know a a when you got a good pad of of money where you know you dont have have when youre not you know you cash flow bound thats where to work at yeah um  i guess um there really havent been a lot of thing that we have picked on that have work for us other then you know vocalizednoise the uh the automatic debits require require more discipline um it also simplifies in that vocalizednoise doesnt require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then make the appropriate trip to the bank or whoever and uh so actually we live in uh in vocalizednoise in Canada and so with our banking system being more national uh it does make uh funds transfer and that kind of thing a lot more yeah ive ive got ive got direct direct deposit i find what i helps a often lot is i have Quicken readily available on my PC and ive got for the next six to eight month all my pay checks all my fix expenses in there so i i can look at my cash flow and i can say you know ive got to pay these on these dates and i can structure these debt payment around here you know not debt payment in sense in the sense you know paying off against you know legal thing like you know paying credit cards off and things so that you know i can really map out and say on this date ill have this cash flow and ill have this net worth and that help an often lot to look forward oh i would think you know i would think it did  yeah i guess you know in the late of budgeting its something that we always have been very week on and i guess for us the challenge is now that weve got a son fifteen and a daughter eighteen that were trying to train  laughter  right well i mean i mean i found it was vocalizednoise for a long time you know i really was living for the moment and i i think that my vocalizednoise i got such mixed message message from my folks about budgeting because vocalizednoise i mean even to this day they their you know both of them are out of work now because of the one full economy in Massachusetts theyre both in social in uh you know uh human services they got hit real good but you know theyre still remodeling stuff and things so you know in in the sense you know they they would criticize me for going out and and and spending money on on things to make myself happy but then they go and you know do do what to me are cosmetic improvement to the house to you know get the same kind of thing now that that more of a value laughteradded to there house then me going out and getting CDs or something but you know its the same kind of thing where they always thought i was getting mixed mixed message about that yeah and thats  that becomes the biggest challenge you know if i think about it myself is the budgeting impact from a parenting role uh it take it takes so long for a person to develop that budgeting skill and theres  i think its going to become more critical because were now  ,family_finance,4212
okay i guess we can just go ahead and start sure enough so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that uh my wife and i both work and i get a fixed amount and im paid once every two weeks and my pay check always the same she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks dont come at the same time mine do and she doesnt get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid oh geez and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have and uh so what weve done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive and thats thats been fairly effective what happens if you get hit with some extraordinary expense hum you mean like recently laughter right well i mean you know vocalizednoise you know before you have a chance to say well geez we have a couple of months where we been low and put some off uh in the bank exactly and thats uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our cars and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one uhhuh ooh and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also weve got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund and thats kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies sources and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing so uh well i mean you dont want to do it that way you rather just keep it all in the in the bank but uh  my gosh no i you know its its funny because when they came on they talked about a home budget and what not i stopped and thought to myself geez we dont have a laughter or turns out that you know dont even have one uh my wife and i also work and uh she work for the federal government and i work almost for the federal laughtergovernment and but its you know fixed income basically you know from pay check to pay check how much youre going to get uh im the only guy that pays any bills i mean she carries the check book but when it comes time vocalizednoise everybody who mails a bill like gas company and the telephone and all of that kind of stuff comes to the house and one of them gets plopped in to my mailbox and then once a week or once every two weeks ill sit down and and write checks well just recently weve weve found out that um weve had her money direct deposited to one account and my money direct deposited to another account a different account huh umhum correct and weve been trying to live off my money which is not working laughterout laughterright so you can the her money and then save it or right exactly weve been trying to well basically we wanted to use her money just to pay the mortgage on the house you know that was that way we wouldnt have to worry about the mortgage it would be covered and then we would have our living expenses on mine and it just hasnt work out you know and it i ive read these budget book and they say well you know you sit down and you figure out how much its costing you to live and all that kind of stuff but uh what ive notice is that its extremely difficult for us to come up with a uh it usually it it well cost it cost us you know uh five hundred dollars a month to live it doesnt work that vocalizednoise one month its five hundred the next month its a valuable uh budget yeah right umhum its a thousand because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to two hundred because uh youre off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didnt spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean its uh thats been my problem weve got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that dont come on a uh monthly or or once every two week bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes every three months so that means that uh uh everytime because we havent uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes we end up paying that whole bill every every three or four month and then that cuts into everything else on it um yeah well i do have to say that uh when you know when we were real serious about budgeting the money and doing all of this my uh sister sent me a book  and it was the book uh Wealth Without Risk by Charles Given and i do have to admit he had one suggestion in there that really ,family_finance,4216
okay vocalizednoise okay okay okay im uh well i do work for a large company uh large meaning about twelve uh twelve thousand people thats big and uh it use to be twice as big so couldve been uh couldve been better ill put it this way when i came to work here it was twenty five thousand and now its twelve thousand and dropping but uh the advantages of a vocalizednoise how how big is the company you work for uh less then a hundred people okay less then a hundred some of the same thing still applies ive work for companys uh your size before and some of the same thing still applies though uh one of the things is like i know a guy whos gone to work for himself and uh after a while he became yeah he was he craved uh vocalizednoise yeah interaction yeah and uh thats one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh do you have internet how did you get hooked up to this uh well i have an internet uh through another i have another internet connection through another network but were in the process of  establishing our own internet feed internet feed so things like that the internet uh access internet access to a library gee how do i say it uh well i think the diversity of a large company is a strong thing for it um the the fact that there are so many different ways that uh working for a company could take you a a large company um granted if your skill your skills were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow to to uh your choices are narrowed but i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess youd call them in a larger company im a systems engineer and i basically design networks um so for our end users and our customer im you know uh im pretty much limited to that thats what thats what i do one of the advantage of uh of a uh larger company and the hundred is uh could be consider a larger company is is uh access to other people that do the same thing if youre the only computer programmer in your company then its its it is kind of isolated and uh so thats one of the advantages uh there are lots of disadvantages of course but uh yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost anything getting anything done at all you have to  many layers to go through yes and one of the things that that uh tends to happen in in a larger company is uh oh how do i say it uh lack of access to uh to people uh they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size uh let see a hundred or so it i in the past uh had access to people who had access to just anything anything anything and everything was uh was available where as in a company like this its very fragmented and im i might be umhum and you have the typical pyramid structure of organization many work groups one man on top or woman um and middle management and the whole nine yards right yeah and so well i can be ten feet away from somebody that is doing the same thing we are structured in the uh in uh in uh bubble uh structure we are many different work groups however we work together um thats by design weve had the same structure for basically for twenty years and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facets into play as theyre needed so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh i i have one fear here i i dont know if i push the one button long enough i think you did do you think you can hear that huh okay because i i havent they havent said that were out of space yet maybe they deleted their temp directory laughter well in the past theyve it you know they seem to shut us off fairly quickly so i i was wondering about that let me try it once more here well um you know we can talk as long as we like or until they tell us ive usually hit the marker to um were not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh so were vocalizednoise were in a were in a bubble diagram and uh thats thats a really effective and i think that is a very nineties kind of thing like i say weve had it for twenty something years and so we are really good at it but uh ,job_benefits,4220
Cathy im in Boston hi um im Ralph um Cincinnati Cincinnati hi Ralph um uh the the machine said that the topic was uh taxes yeah um weather we pay too much or uh maybe we got back what we uh because we got i guess to die for what we paid okay well im im ready anytime that you want to start um lets see i guess we got one oh yeah go head well lets see i guess uh since im in the process of filling them out i guess i kind of fill like uh its it is too much but i dont know what i uh cut out i guess no i i know what you mean were in the process of doing ours and it it it does seems  like a lot uh i wish i had a better feeling for uh a better breakdown rather than oh well you know X X billions of dollars go to defense and X billions of dollars go here it it its hard i i have a hard time conceiving of any larger amount of money then say uh really a couple thousand dollars every thing else is is like Monopoly money it its so larger you dont really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car you get a better feeling for for whats going on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands but uh i vocalizednoise Americans in general well i i would like to see a little bit better return for the the social program i actually dont mind paying taxes for things like social programs helping people out because my basic philosophy is that that most people are out to mess with the system most people actually generally want to work or want to to make themselves better and they are not lazy i dont believe that everybody is out there to rip of the system but there is a hold lot of bureaucracy and so many places for the money to fall through the cracks that after a while it becomes to easy and and and people uh say well oh sure well we we havent plan ahead so we could spend twice as much as as what we really need thats okay we will just let it go and and then it comes down to the crunch and crisis management and oh well just spend another few thousands dollars and so there theres no good handle on it no one i guess feels really responsible in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset thats interesting but uh i guess thats uh something that happen when there is so many people involved each one fill like they vocalizednoise take a responsibility for making sure that thing work the way there suppose to or something but um i never really thought of it that way but i guess there vocalizednoise seems like their some programs that are more valuable and other that be vocalizednoise that be useful to have more uh sort of tax payer involvement in some of that decision making oh sure yeah i know i agree with you on that what sort of a involvement with with something like maybe oh a defenses a little hard but but what sort of involvement uh would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see on that i know maybe just in the point of you know having focus group with uh or elected representative will be one solutions where they actually maybe they do have more in some area of the country then then where im from but its i think its rare to actually no like you can influence what uh your representative is really doing because if you know if even if theres even a lot of writing campaign chances are therell be a lot of letters on both sides of the issue particularly if if it is a controversial bill or something like that huh yeah well here it here in Massachusetts i mean we have a just like the rest of the country we have a a server budget problem and and often here uh people are are angry about their taxes being so high and the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state and many people fall back on well theres money theres a lot of money being misspent its all there we do have to do anything except well its all out there somewhere and the the the next step is to identify where vocalizednoise ,taxes,4222
okay well are you still there yeah im here yeah uh we got real good benefits where im at although theyre becoming uh less and less every year so that theyre taking a little bit more away uh especially when it comes to health care benefits do you guys uh have full coverage where youre at yeah well we do um its its funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs in general yeah our benefits uh we we have a choice between an HMOs between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical Blue Cross Blue Shield and um seems like the main idea of insurance companies is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible yeah yeah i i i agree uh you you pay a lot of money into them and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesnt meet their uh you know their their minimum amounts or something like that theyve always got these uh these plans set up where they theyve got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain operation or something but when you go to that doctor its always like ten or fifteen dollars more than what theyll pay for and uh thats one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh the the primary or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the doctors around here charge seventy five so it doesnt really keep up with what they actually have so its kind of a they vocalizednoise they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh yeah absolutely other thing about Pratts benefits uh when i first came here five years ago they really had like the best i thought that id ever had and since then you know theyve for the staggering skyrocketing uh medical costs like youve said uh theyve really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company yeah its expensive uh its very expensive for the company to uh to pay all the benefits out uh if you want to talk for a second about non health benefits uh at my office we have free drinks free beverages and uh thats really popular thats very uh a lot of people like that where we have uh all kinds of uh uh well here we call it pop i guess on the east coast youd call it soda and uh juices and oh you have soda oh coffee and tea and uh uh spring water hot and cold and soups and thats well thats pretty good benefit then yeah its very nice uh often if youre just having trouble thinking and doing your work you can just get up and walk to the kitchen and uh make yourself a cup of tea a fresh cup of tea herbal tea or whatever and well i didnt i guess i never really thought about that as a benefit we we can get up and go to our cafeteria and you know and pay to get something to drink but i guess i guess that is kind of a benefit to just to have a place to go do that yeah oh definitely it gives you a chance yeah we we have a real nice cafeteria we can go to that anytime during the day and its always it is always nice to go down there and get a coffee or a tea or a juice sure absolutely and get your and give your mind a rest yeah that thats thats always good uh do you guys have like a savings plan uh well the company offers a K but they dont contribute at all uh our uh we were really lucky in that respect our for every dollar we put in Pratt Whitneyll match us sixty cents so that is great that that that thats real good and thats thats one reason why i really like that yeah that that that is a very nice benefit one of the things that we have lacking is the number of vacation days we have uh only two weeks vacation a year does it depend on how many years youve been there no its just across the board wow thats really something uh at Pratt its uh if youre there eight years or less its two weeks and as soon as you get your eight year in you get three weeks and then when you get uh fifteen years you get another week so you know a guy whos been out been out there for like twenty five thirty years get about uh you know five weeks vacation paid a year yeah well in the technology industry its such a young industry that there arent very many people that have been in it for a very long time so they dont have the same uh oh okay scale although at other jobs ive had ive ive had three weeks vacation so uh so stripping down to two was uh how are your how how how important is that you know your benefits when you sound like youve uh done some job hopping youve had more than one job then uh three ive had three oh okay with that how many how much time did you spend with each one very short oh okay the first the first job with the first two were a year and a half each and uh and after that i worked for two years at the company im at where i plan to stay for a while okay and and thats up in in Pittsburgh you said thats right thats right but you know in the the computer the computer industry is a little bit more liberal with benefits in general i think than other industries um in terms of uh flex hours and just the you know the whole attitude of the work place ah thats another thats another benefit i forgot to mention we have flex time you also have that thats right thats one of my favorite benefits uh ever since ive been ever since i graduated from school in eighty six every job ive had

 so uh how do you go about doing household finances laughter pretty loosely laughter i dont have a ive never have a laughter laughteryeah me too laughter had a tremendously organized budget ive you know kind of know how much the monthly bills are by you know looking at the previous month and i know about what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight uh organized budget that you stay within ive ive just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes boy me too its uh fly by the seat of my pants uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage then she dropped out of the work force and uh we we have two children both under four so uh oh wow i ive taken total responsibility but i guess i havent taken vocalizednoise youve got two now under four yeah yeah wow laughter theyll laughterbe yeah theyll be uh four and two in April respectively ive got a senior in high school whos just just getting out in May were probably the same age laughter yeah im forty four forty two yeah most most of my friends have uh children uh you who are having children it seems like but uh we vocalizednoise we actually ran one checkbook with i mean one account with two checkbooks off the same account for a long for a long time but thats real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesnt or or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other one about laughterit laughteror laughtersomething you know so we finally switched to the two method too it seemed to work better yeah i think when uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility uh  it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff oh sure now its my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesnt im not being critical but my wife kind of has the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check you know and its unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but its almost that attitude you still got checks you still got money right laughter yeah right yeah laughterthats laughteryeah thats kind of how it comes out well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run mine and uh not really mix the two and uh the you know bills that are if were both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then one or of the other of us writes the other one a check for their portion and then one person mails it all you know to the to the bank or whoever if its something were doing that way if its uh if its something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do yeah well how how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh in our in our case its more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months were really going to watch it and well try try to control the big things uh its kind of the way it is its its never been uh like my brother is organized to the nth degree he and i are exactly opposite hes two years younger than i am and he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and hes a real tight wad with uh the money and ive always been a little looser well thats how we both are and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh during a a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then thats kind of a joint yeah we we thing too so yeah we went through a period uh well we went through six years of infertility and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that oh yeah those are  and my wife was working at the time so it it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasnt too difficult with the two incomes and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldnt have children so we sort of indulged and we uh leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it thatll do it everytime you immediately get pregnant if you do that laughter well thats what exactly what happened yeah we ,family_finance,4238
so how do you like the benefits of TI um well actually to tell you the truth uh not very well i resigned from Texas Instruments not shortly oh thats right yeah ago and found that my uh after having worked there for twenty one years my vested interest in my pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary yeah thats thats one problem with uh engineering jobs is its you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a either K well i guess you get part of into K one oh K but what what is the uh key health plan that people who are privately employed use um i dont know uh the the uh i guess i guess the that that issue was a TI retirement uh benefit is it is what they call a defined a defined benefits program which means if you retire you get benefits if you dont retire you get shit uh but i think the government sort of passed some kind of legislation some long time ago that said well you cant do that you cant just kiss them off if they dont retire and so theres some nominal uh amount amount that has to be vested with the employee but uh in this modern day and age where there is job mobility i mean uh its time for employers to stop screwing the employees out of their retirement benefits by invoking this uh defined benefits plan what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on your last salary when you left the company so you know lets say youve worked there for twenty years you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone um you know your twenty years is worthless just because its its not an index to fund its based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there which is all the more reason i think that the employee should have control over his pension account um of course the initial question that was asked related to uh actually i cant remember anymore but to it benefits benefits in general  it related to what do you look for in a position other than salary and i guess my mind before it referred to benefits my mind was not thinking a long the with the ideas lines of benefits at all but rather career gratification gratification and you know that kind of thing well thats one thing you do get with a large company theyre you know its well its actually can go both ways something some ways you have more opportunities because therere so many things going on within the company but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in to to any area they want to boy i there there were some something happened to your signal your signal at that point did you notice it yeah there there was some clicking on the line im not sure what whether thats local or somewhere in the long distance network between New Jersey and wherever you are in California California okay or whether its part of the uh switchboard system this is also possible somewhere between Texas well  party of my part of my reason for coming to California was California uh it is it i love it its a wonderful place but the the price of housing is is just totally well it depends on where you go if you go up uh far enough north it doesnt it gets cheaper again but then again theres you you well thats true up in Redding uh the housing prices are probably comparable to Dallas where i came from but down here the housing prices are about a factor of five higher which is really ridiculous yeah i know New Jersey is just slightly above the national average which was yeah its about twice the price of Atlanta at any rate but uh the housing the housing prices have definitely dropped  so i guess one of the things you look for in a job uh is um affordable cost of living yeah cost cost of living cost of housing is the salary enough to allow me to do the activities i want to do of course the most wonderful thing for the company and the most wonderful thing for the employee too is if what you want to do is to work yes  not so great for the family but uh ,job_benefits,4240
well uh vocalizednoise i guess that was it um i guess the uh its interesting that they asked the benefits question i think because uh we just merged with another um division in our company and actually have different slightly different benefits so i guess the the things id look for um kind of things i call like safety net features like health insurance and uh possibly um retirement pension sorts of incentives and then i guess theres the things for like personal growth like uh educational reimbursement tuition like tuition reimbursement or uh maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness center or something like that would be yeah but vocalizednoise be interested in seeing i think its important to have some place to go over the years in a within a company uh i work for uh a university but we do defense contracts and  with my job theres not much place to go i mean theres not theres not what youre hired in as is what you end up as and the benefits are okay but id rather have more security thats interesting yeah i i was actually at uh Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh doing uh um i guess on research staff there and i i got a feeling that uh you know there wasnt really it wasnt really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like vocalizednoise a doctorate in something and then you could you know look at the youd be eligible for the uh you know the uh are are you uh with with a university system now more important position than you are well vocalizednoise well no im not im sorry im at uh im actually doing um consulting in the commercial um what in in industry when i say it was a i like security but what we did was a uh mostly radar some counter stuff for Russians and things so i dont really exactly have a whole lot of laughtersecurity laughterright laughternow well thats interesting since uh theyre not doing so good theyre not a threat anymore so yeah but it seems like other uh the other people that are on the verge or already have missiles that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection yeah im im  most all those systems are the same they came were originated Soviet Union so oh okay so its not viewed as thats interesting its not real good you have good good benefits like vacation days does that mean much to you um actually i never thought of that i i i i guess i assumed thats part of the uh package but um i guess if the salary was you know enough then i might just make my own you know take the unpaid time off but uh um as long as you know its not uh i guess whats more important than vacation is actually having the time to use it because a lot of times were in projects where you know where the dates are critical and its its a little harder to plan a vacation when youre in that kind of environment we have it pretty good because i we we take our vacation anytime we want by the hour by the day its good i really like that if its a pretty day uh if the works not pressing i go fishing yeah vocalizednoise that means a lot to me it it it takes a lot of the stress of the job out too so so like a consistent work load would that be kind of a vocalizednoise is that vocalizednoise i dont know if thats considered a benefit its just in kind of part of the environment youre in vocalizednoise well were spaced in timing too uh when we get toward the end of a contract then its uh you cant leave and were always behind time behind schedule out of money you have to donate your time and we charge you know about four accounting purposes to the projects so theres no way that that you can take off vacation and charge it back to the project yeah huh so theyre out of money so i dont know my next job i think im going to look at health insurance closer than i did this one yeah it its only been a problem i guess in our organization seems like um about the year after i joined was when they started passing on a lot higher percentage of the increases they were getting from the carriers but ive got an HMO um with mine because ive got vocalizednoise what what sort of monthly uh uh charges are uh are you uh married do you have family yeah uh one were growing another um a little boy on the way it looks like all right well whats your monthly for your uh the health insurance so uh uh lets see its um like thirty dollars a pay period so its every two weeks so its about ,job_benefits,4254
 ill start in the first place i dont have a family and i dont have a budget laughter i dont either laughter neither do i laughter its called scraping together laughter its called what laughter scraping together laughter yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we werent really destitute but we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money and so now i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget well i my family was vocalizednoise they were okay because i mean my dad uh he um was in the military and then he also had like two other jobs so we lived comfortably id say but um i pretty well i i get paid i work for the state um i get paid like once a month so i i kind of learn to to set aside a certain amount of money it you know that i could spend each week for like lunch and all this other kind you know expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it laughter so you dont keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your income what you income is and stuff uh well i know what my income is but uh uh my but as far as keeping records i i i have a a ledger that will uh uh how much i owe people whatever and i deduct it out of that oh so you do keep track of it yeah i i i keep i i keep track of it uh im not exactly accurate of it every month i mean laughter but you know i keep up with it like once every other month or so get it caught up do you actually balance it at the end of the month uh yeah im not real good about uh keeping track in checks and stuff like that but uh uh i always keep track of of the ledger who i pay and when and whatever and what the balance is well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since ive had a checkbook and im im thirty two now so for i guess fourteen or fifteen years ive had a checking account but ive never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check id transfer five hundred dollars in and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the banks and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking you know i should really do that laughter and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so itd keep the balance for me well i work with uh im work with an an accounting uh section of Department of Corrections in in North Carolina for the state so i i work with Lotus and DataEase a lot so i im real familiar with that so that comes second nature to you yeah my i still havent balanced i figure if i keep doing keep this up long enough eventually someday itll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced well i bank with Wachavia and they have this vocalizednoise system of of where you can call a number you can call and get all your checks and what your balance is and and what checks is cleared that month or whatever and i do that like maybe twice a month i check to see what you know what checks ive written and always write paid on it when its paid so i get an idea you know subtract what laughter what what i have in you know in the in my account and what ive ive written checks for that havent been cleared or whatever so i keep up with it that way too yeah well you spend more time on it than i do thats for sure uh i wouldnt say that i just you know i just i just dont want to write bad laughterchecks does your balance match balance match the banks at the at the end of the month um for the most part yeah i i ive got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me and tells me i need to get the money in or whatever so i say okay and i get it to her oh i dont get that i just get a letter that says we just charged you ten dollars please take care of this oh i wish i wish mined only charge me ten dollars or here they charge eighteen oh so you get a personal call but you also get the charge well not not all the time its its like uh this time i i i filed electronically my taxes and uh i didnt have quite enough for my mortgage payment and um i told her and i said im waiting for them to file that and they said if the mortgage payment you know check gets that before that and i said but it should be you know i it should be deposited before it hits but and it it didnt the mortgage check hit before but she told me that if it did not to worry about it that she would just uh she she wouldnt charge me she since i let her know a head of time that i was waiting on that and whatever so but the the mortgage payment was due so yeah you like to live on the edge i see laughter well sometimes yeah laughter uh uh i believe in that philosophy of of praying that it dont hit the bank before the check does or laughterdeposit laughterdoes if i want something bad enough i ill do it but normally i dont do that but in case its something thats vocalizednoise ,family_finance,4271
 ive got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our moneys worth um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste its about uh twenty percent of the federal budget isnt it at this moment its terrible you know its huge i have no idea what the actual number really is but it but you cant unfortunately you cant do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and not at this point in the business cycle you cant yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in twenty years ago we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after World War Two and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh then at the end of the Johnson Administration the budget Nixons first year that was that was uh set up by Johnson was balanced and that was the last balanced budget weve got well of course part of the problem is that that um the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit yeah absolutely i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions we yeah absolutely and thats thats a terrible problem as well we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen eighty six began as a tax simplification law which wouldve made it easier to enforce and wouldve saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order umhum umhum and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i wouldve said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent im going to veto it well as much as thats a bad thing i think that uh theres some other really major major things that need straightened out and youd mentioned waste a little while ago and uh ive seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasnt going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts that company said theyd go ahead and build these things and they didnt build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there another thing that that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at ATT Gilford Center and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy im not sure what its called vocalizednoise called but its some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean theyre still working with a sixteen bit address space uh no and theyre writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago i dont know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but youd think at some stage theyd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current yeah i really wish there was some solution to this vocalizednoise bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big well the Republican solution is to cut taxes and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesnt solve it we havent gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result its gotten worse but uh not limiting taxes didnt hasnt stopped uh the government from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now weve got this giant deficit on top of things thats right thats right um so i i i dont know i mean there there theres only three things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment people dont want programs cut although uh im not sure that some of them shouldnt be looked at more carefully programs uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids uh im a little concerned about that im a little concerned laughterabout cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them uhhuh uhhuh but uh theres there there you know Governor Thompson of Wisconsin has an idea which is pay the fathers of these children to marry the mothers and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the fathers to take up some of the some of ,taxes,4295
 topic today theres a sound like a panel topic were talking about uh what we can do to make uh make uh our government get a little more for its money in other words vocalizednoise short and long longterm goals yeah vocalizednoise short longterm goals to be able to get a better value out of what we already pay and i wanted to say something to you about Ross Perot are you familiar with the man uh ive ive watched him yes hes vocalizednoise hes ive been told that that he uh well his ideologies wont work because hes too much of an authoritarian yeah but he does raise some interesting points like he does i i i from just his speaking i i i hear a a very a strong tinge of integrity uhhuh the uh the the question he raised in my mind was uh he was speaking in front of the National Press Club the other day and he said vocalizednoise lets think of some wild and crazy things to do to wipe out the four hundred billion dollar deficit that weve got um vocalizednoise remember were thinking about wild and crazy things well throw anything out he said um lets say we take all the profits of the fortune five hundred for a year not enough money only half as much as we need so another words four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money uh and thats just he deficit just this year theres apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the presidents own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement i think that would be the shortterm goals get rid of the fraud and mismanagement um apparently they have plenty of time the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well its going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me but are we what do you think are we talking about the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think its the human element its a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help exactly yes could help track oh sure uh and and find out whats going on you know statistical crossreferencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know they do to keep in office to stay in office uh i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we dont limit congress critters at all i think Dave i think one of the another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also we the American people dont have faith in the government and they dont have faith in business yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they uh its something that everyone can identify with and and uh if they cant even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from GM and theyre theyre making four and five times theyre making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year um oh that GM is trying to market their products and is that thats another way is that the consumers just dont trust big business they just dont theres so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and theyre just going whats this yeah i think um its uh ive been studying some libertarian views and ive been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of out of business and away from business and out of everybodys hair you know i i i mean i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with democracy with you know our capitalistic government the almighty dollar doesnt have any ethical code with it and i its just like how you know what would you do the Exxon Valdez you see what what are we just just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because the in the our capitalistic society its just those controls its just its the business it starts going and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and were polluting something unfortunately ,budget,4310
uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them uh pretty good actually i work for Hewlett Packard and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package in fact theyre theyre kind of known uh for having good benefits the pay isnt fabulous although i saw a survey recently and im actually making just about as much as you know im making making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me so oh thats good what kind of a degree have you got ive got a Bachelors in electrical engineering so and im not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good weve got stock purchase program and a that thats pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain but uh  theres a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income uh theres how long have you been with them ive been with them for seven years uh thats good yeah and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years its pretty soon youre completely vested in the retirement plan and everything so uh its not too but theres full uh there theres several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything i dont get sick that often so i dont pay much of it but you know i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever they dont cover eyes though and i i have contact lenses so thats kind of a pain but you know i i can live but for for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered oh yeah yeah so that youve got got small small things to gripe about wow well that sounds like you must feel really good about it yeah yeah and and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing because uh i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but thats not the case so i laughter guess nothing its fabulous uhhuh uhhuh uh the what about you well i uh work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory i also have a part time job at a law firm and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does uh and benefits through the government are uh really uh  they just uh theyre not the greatest uh i before i i uh  uh got my degree im uh computer a computer scientist and before i got my degree i had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington and uh at that time i was in gravy city uh the law firms laughter in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties and uh benefits were just amazing and we had everything paid for and uh anyway with the government its not uh quite that nice a deal uh but its you know its its okay what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs and its deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet and uh  so i i think im actually involved in a relatively good plan plan at this point um but uh it could be better thats for sure and uh  but you know there there are other things that you get when you work for the government i uh in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere its really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i dont have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and  so im im really kind of happy about that end of of things its uh yeah the one of the things with my company is that theyve uh got a reputation for a lot of job security and uh theres a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do so theres uh i myself have moved around quite a bit within the company and its and i and i havent had to move my residence to do that you know i still live in San Jose and wow thats fabulous you see now thats thats interesting because i have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area he he lives in Andover yeah it oh yeah and uh the work that he hes uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the Hewlett Packard machines that do uh  uh sonographic imagining and uh ive been over to see his complex over there and its amazing its its all ecologically designed and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up yeah yeah in fact i know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who i used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position kind of interesting um uh anyhow ,job_benefits,4319
 Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or or or what do you think well thats laughter thats a really hard question i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths um  i lets example uh our our friend the President right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases so uh i know the politicians uh arent arent straightforward now in in terms of economics im not its hard hard to call it really is see i never thought really its uh  i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not were paying too much or too little i i always thought that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment for instance like Social Security tax or Social uh i mean thats thats tax were paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us hm right laughter thats yeah i you know when i when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week i or each every other week i i really think that moneys history and you know so as far as return investment thats not thats nothing and were not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back yes uh uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh theres still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in DC that are researching to find a cure for polio which i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know and and staff it with people its really tough to close it down and and they just havent yet well yeah im not exactly sure uh about polio in particular i know we have a polio vaccine which will prevent somebody from getting polio im not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing somebody who has already gotten polio well that might be the difference i dont know uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on TV lately is uh had to do with its like seventy five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically that that historical for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians yeah its its its funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is been trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh congressional congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals and the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing so it sounds like you uh you think that that wed be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto i i think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste on the other hand uh uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things laughter right and just to get rid of the unimportant things and whenever theres that kind of subjective judgment  theres always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exactly where the boundary between waste and and necessity is so im not im not sure that that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is is a problem with uh i forgot theres a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something yeah pork barrel politics uh pork barrel politics there there there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh well i i lived in Massachusetts for a while and uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasnt necessarily so popular yeah but Massachusetts wasnt when Dukakis was there anyway wasnt in that great shape financially but at least at the end uhhuh i mean i dont know i yeah i i they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and uh thats part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out its uh i mean its its tough i mean theres theres two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that theyll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot and spare the economy yeah its really its a hard balance it it definitely is even not for government even just say for a small business um i know some ,taxes,4333
so Cathy um do you keep a monthly budget well we we do of sorts its not a its not a family budget both my my husband and i work and what we do is basically treat each income as separate uh partly we didnt want to fall into the trap of arguing over the family money oh yeah well you know i earned this much and therefore i have the right to spend that and well you know you overspent the the total budget this way each of us knows whats in our own bank accounts so you can if you want to write a check for somebodys birthday present you dont have to worry about the other person seeing it that sort of thing but uh whats unique is that uh my husband keeps a spreadsheet of uh the income and he submits a bill to me every month an itemized bill and i pay that and then so he has track of both of our expenses i pay part of the utilities he pays part of the utilities it takes a little bit more work but it does work for us i mean it it really does work very successfully for us do you have any kids yes im laughteri am juggling one right now on my lap uh we have a uh almost one he hell be one on on April second you can hear him and the one is four and hes off taking a bath laughter so uh yeah weve got two kids and uh well i can hear him right there so how does that work into your budget uh well what as far as planning for expenses and so forth well in terms of of immediate expenses like clothing um i purchase those out of my income and i get reimbursed fifty percent of that by my husband so again i submit bills to him laughter receipts to him uh for the day care uh what we do is actually take that directly out of my income um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction uh medical and uh child care uh all together so um that that helps for for that planning hum until they you wouldnt happen to work for Liberty Mutual would you excuse me no no no a a biotech company as a laughtermatter of fact Liberty Mutual that thats vocalizednoise my company and thats exactly what we have yeah and it it works out it works out really well now in terms of long term like college expenses uh right now we dont have something thats set up thats labeled college we have uh more along the lines of um uh sort of investment plans in each of the childrens names and they were set up as as first birthday presents or or or even newborn presents from the grandparents just you know the the actually assembled and set up uh all the investment decisions are are now ours but in terms of retirement thats the one area that that is is still a little sticky because you you you sort of have your retirement plans through your companies and we spent so much time trying to to make sure that the boys are okay laughter that and you know for our own retirement theres not a whole lot actually organized but we do have uh the things through our companies so thats thats a start anyway yeah this is uh the first year that actually the first month that ive actually instituted a budget uh for my wife and i for the previous nine years or so weve just pretty much let it slide um there really wasnt much problem as far as income versus expenses uh things are getting a little bit tighter uh we bought a house last year we bought a new vehicle things that which werent a problem before have have all sudden we noticed our cash flow is starting to decline a little bit you know with all the monthly bills and uh uh so far its working out pretty well you know were keeping an eye on what we spend each week but like i said being one of the first months we really wont know for a few more months down the road how well were doing but your plan where you you submit bills thats the most itemized plan ive ever seen or heard anyone talk about as far as married couples well its not its not actually too bad once you get the spreadsheet the spreadsheet set out by my husband has categories for things like utilities uh you know other expenses uh the rent and my contribution i dont make as much financially as he does so my contribution is prorated it doesnt come it doesnt come fifty percent out of my pocket when i dont make fifty percent of the income uh you know which is nice its fair fair enough uh so actually what it what happens is that we gather all the bills and then write them down and then uh well uh after that its just a question of putting them into the computer and the computer generates you know i mean it it takes the percentage thats necessary and he prints out a bill and i write a check and thats it um once its set up it works it works reasonable well so it it most of my friends though when they find out about it they they they think your husband submits a bill to you thats thats thats weird laughter thats really weird but we dont i mean i ,family_finance,4338
 i guess ill give my opinions here first okay uh in terms of taxes here i guess uh i feel like we are paying an awful lot of them uh and getting apparently very little for it uh especially since uh the things that i think that our taxes are going for are i i guess in my opinion not the uh appropriate necessarily appropriate things i think that uh uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education and less on on programs which are permanent black holes which will never do anything but continue to be uh uh sponges for money i mean we need to do uh programs which are more on the concept of well like one of the concepts they had before was trying to renovate the housing but uh then turning the housing over that now see i i agreed with that one and im not very often into those kind of those kind of programs but that one made sense help these people to fix their houses to improve their their environment i mean uh uh projects projects were the most idiotic concept in the world you had they had no sense of ownership no sense of responsibility like a warehouse almost it well it was like its just a place for you to stay and you had no uh feeling of of responsibility ownership concern uh in fact it was insulting it was it was almost insulting it was embarrassing it was so embarrassing that i you know i i i i dont know exactly what the motivations were but basically they were destroyed they were they uh you know people would strew feces across the uh uh rooms you know just incredible the abuses that occured it was obviously a failed concept okay laughter so yes i think we do have problems with taxes laughter well  uhhuh well the uh unfortunate truth is that no matter what sort of a program or whatever that uh gets put out there and made available by the taxpayers money there is going to be someone who will abuse it they will find a way people are very creative especially those that are on the public dole and want to be there uh they can be very creative in their in their abuses and not surprisingly some of the worst offenders are the people who are inside the system and are in a position to know exactly where the red flags would be what they can get away with uh i happen to work for an assemblyman at one time and i saw abuse of power there uh really subtle but it was still there okay uh the man was not a millionaire uh however he could have never gone to work again and lived comfortably and uh he owned a lot of low income housing for which he got considerable government aid refurbish it and and it was all legal oh sure and oh doing a public service and like like i say youre right in that were paying an awful lot well not really comparatively to other countries uh other countries especially European countries they pay a larger percentage than we do but the things that they get in return are more tangible to the common person national health care uh education systems that you know thats one of mine own pet peeves is how can how can our teachers be so damn efficient well if its nothing okay that they laughtercan teach our students in a hundred and eighty days what it takes Europe two hundred and forty days to teach you know how can they be that good come on  come on well i uh then what it really comes down to the fact that uh uh we dont have enough balls to actually make these programs work umhum  uh well part part of the symptom symptom of a democratic system system is that it it kind of uh freezes itself up you very seldom able able able able to do anything thats strong on either side whether it be left or right i mean i mean sometimes i say you know even though i tend to go with the with the conservative line i sit there and i say you know at least if we did something it would be better than what we do now oh yeah um who it was Ross Perot was speaking in front of the National Press Club and he was talking about how people in the government say well you know weve got a hundred and eighty billion dollars in fraud and mismanagement okay a hundred eighty billion dollars a year just sort of going out of window and why dont they do anything to stop it well itd cost a billion dollars to track all the fraud and mismanagement well guess what i think thats a really good return on investment dont you oh yeah a billion versus a hundred and eighty billion ,taxes,4343
 well i think that theres uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um  facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day i i definitely agree on that um im working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that theyre desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever um yeah same here um laughter but as far as what id really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could if there was some sort of provided provided facility for that um maybe a locker area a shower area to change to take a shower before work and some place to lock the bicycles up and ive heard of a lot of other companies providing that that would be something to look forward to lets see another one id like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours laughter well a lot depends on the job though laughter  yeah  what do you do  well right now im still in school im still a student but the ability to oh okay you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that yeah that would be nice i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment youre in  yeah um  im right now also a full time student and uh but i work in the evenings for the law firm so its a rather yeah its a rather interesting uh  rather interesting interesting set up  work full time go to school full time yeah that can be rough yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that  swore to never do it again i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of um  like the family in some in somebodys in the way that somebody relates to the work place how so um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more they get um allowances for um you know have being married or having children i dont really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case well they do but um they get housing and stuff like that  yeah i have friends that are in the military and they do get quite a lot of perks and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that  right right but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i dont know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how you know here hed spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places hed worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing some kind of consideration there would be nice as well i dont know what would be the solution i suppose uh not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place if theyre just gonna pork you in the end um what a lot what a lot of companies do is far as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family in a lot of cases i know thats the case in my office at least theyll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and dependent codependent children not like the case applies to me but um it is nice that they offer it yeah its a good consideration for families thats absolute necessity in todays world and price definitely and health insurance costs man theyre getting so expensive right now i dont have any health insurance its kind of disturbing unless you you youre not still covered under your parents no im gonna be thirty this year but laughter oh wow laughter when you said you were going to school full time laughter and yeah im working on my PhD oh thats different  its a long road  but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh theyve got a really minimum plan and itll cover you you know and as a student you dont need a whole lot if if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then  right what school is this Georgia Tech in Atlanta  oh wow  but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasnt prepared to pay for it im not too sure what im gonna do about that right now theres still another six months to go and its not a pleasant feeling worrying about that right now right now the company that my company that picks up the insurance they pay i think its thirty dollars a month so thatll be at three sixty a year and thats basic uh group health coverage is there any deductible with that or anything like ,job_benefits,4350
 okay thanks  huh um do yall have a budget well um  yeah we we do um weve been married for twenty three years and we have um three teenage daughters and you know theyre very expensive so um  uh we yeah we have somewhat of of a system um its its kind of um you know its its kind of hard to explain weve actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts we always had just one and now were having two um its kind of hard to talk about this because to me its very personal yeah its um so i have to be thats thats kind of the way i feel about it you know yeah i usually uh my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course were the like everybody like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know and uh do you have a two income family or one income uh we have a two income uh family she also works and uh but she she enjoys it you know and and shes good at it um if its if its i am kind of uh uh im im pretty bad about procrastinating and one one of these days i am gonna do something about that but you know laughter you know how that goes but uh uh if but she she handles it pretty well she uh yeah yeah she writes all the checks you know once a month so your wife is that what her is is her career uh related to to finance or accounting um sort of on a peripheral shes an annuity annuity annuitityannuity administrator and so she uh she works for an insurance company but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and uh yeah so thats sort of related to her field a little bit yeah sort of and we you know weve experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh but if you know you have to keep up with them so a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear we try to keep our um  our retirement and our savings kind of automated so we never see that money just like taken directly its just taking it out right right yeah yeah we do the same thing yeah and that thats kind of handy yeah because if you dont see it you dont miss laughterit laughterand uh you dont spend it laughter yeah if if you have something to take it out thats exactly what weve always done and weve had uh theyve always had um where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then theyll match it um that you know weve done that too but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess but he was with another company before that but we have we have i i work also but i only have a part time job and i get paid very little but um you know i try to use that money for food money Jim gives me a certain amount money you know we just transfer it into my account and then i use that for food household expenses and then i add my own check to that and then with that i try and handle yeah umhum you know some of the clothes that the girls need and and things like that but the expenses that we need around have around the house yeah so sounds like yall pretty much do it the same we do just kind of play it by ear but but keep the the deductions you know  coming on yeah we well Jim has Jim has a budget i mean he works it out every month and writes it all down um you know im given so much money money a month so i am supposed to kind of get the food out of that so i try not to you know we dont you know i dont ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have umhum yeah  uhhuh and uh you can buy you can really waste a lot of money that way so um well how long have you been married yeah  uh about five years yeah oh yeah so youre just really getting started laughter so do you have a family too yeah uh ive got one little girl shes like uh nineteen months oh yeah yeah so uh shes shes not uh she hasnt affected your budget yet really not not really not too bad uh no no not like she will later on youll youll see that because all of a sudden youre paying youre trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do yeah yeah when and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didnt have much of a budget and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older um but um but what do you do do you im uh i i work for im an electronic technician i work at uh for a university uh Georgia Tech uh research oh okay oh well good good as a so i just uh well we just have yeah we have a good friend thats about to move to Atlanta i guess were not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook oh well laughter and it would be very hard for me because i wouldnt have i wouldnt have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what im spending and it is so much ,family_finance,4353
 okay  now well lets see i see im gonna im gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this im not real i dont have a budget laughter uh what i basically am a do is i i have a a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with laughter and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments so im real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how im going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want laughter or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and thats it right okay well thats good position to be in i guess if you dont have to worry about budgeting that whats left over goes to investments so you dont you dont then actually plan that this month im gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be well the one thing ive always done is ive put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess thats sort of a budget then at least partial right and right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh i knew i could i would be able to do that and that uh you you have to be uh responsible for your own uh  retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i said i i know that i will always be able to afford this and i said that well you know if i if i start making a significant more amount of money i i would put more into it umhum sure sure and make a new budget but ive uh its cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better laughter so ive actually probably making less money than i was when i started laughter umhum okay so although i have not changed i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less right right sure well i think laughterthats laughtertrue laughterof laughterall laughterof laughterus the um well my wife and i both work and we do plan uh we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we dont spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one so i wouldnt just go out and buy a well that  you know a i dont know a new computer laughter uh without laughter well certainly certainly your in a family situation you youd expect a little bit more uh uh you more structured and well thats true thats true uh certainly when youre single you dont have to worry about consulting with someone else and uh that type of thing  right i just kind of consult  with uh uh me myself and i you know laughter uhhuh sure sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay right laughter thats right  uh yeah i see so that makes that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier um and ive always been fairly conscientious ive never really i i dont buy anything really on a whim i do buy things that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state so youre careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy right you know i i i dont just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it sure sure and then i buy it okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if were going to get something you know whatever it may be and were comfortable and have most the things we need or want the but i do wed you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new VCR or something even once we had planned that thats what we were going to get we wouldnt just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if wed planned to get the thing right my ive always laughter you know thats what what  an accusation that an awful lot of people make towards our ,family_finance,4367
 so lets talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there well actually i dont think theyre out of line Devils Devils advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether whether or not you agree with that law it youre still circumventing it you are legal in in your circumvention of that law what what if youre not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you dont even realize that youre subject to paying um income tax on something that you purchase mail order uh really i i i dont think thats a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware theyre not paying that six percent sales tax um some naturally some some things you just cant find in your local KMart or or  um Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but then then then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because its just because the state cant really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax well i mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order its not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania its because im sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh its because i i cant find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that and i think that its not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i dont i dont think that thats my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer i ill agree it its not your responsibility but is but is it also legal for you to do that what what from from what i understand from various various various net readings it it it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that will do your arguments still apply well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then i dont argue with it because its not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need  to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania which is exactly what businesses do at the present right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question thats a cost of doing business the burden shouldnt be placed on the consumer and i i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it thats my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesnt pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay and there reasons there are some some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax a as if no businesses um if or purchasing purchasing things mail order if i if im a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh from from say Utah um i i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my apartment accounting department will at the end of the month uh i think that  i think thats the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC yeah see im unfamiliar with that because i dont i never see that end of the business so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer um but if thats the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that um the opportunity for to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided thats true is is a real a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a  a a loss i i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue thats being lost um and i i dont know if i agree with that but it but ,taxes,4372
 okay okay what do you do we use a monthly budget um my husband and i my husband works i dont and um he brings home the paycheck laughter and we have a budget or a balance sheet is what we call it we have different columns for different areas of our budget and we budget out a certain amount for each month or each pay period and then we try not to go over that laughter and so anyway what do you do well when when i was married my husband budgeted you know very very tightly but then every time there was any uh and he made sure of it if there was any extra money for anything he spent it oh laughter right so you know that that type of budget i didnt function you know i didnt uh i felt like i was getting the short end of the stick right umhum you know so uh but im im divorced now so i dont even have a bank account i have a my the company that im working for has a credit union and i put in the credit union every week a substantial amount of my check and then when i have some extra monthly uh or quarterly bills like insurances and taxes and things like that then i draw out of that savings account to cover those extra expenses and uh i you know im still very uh very tight with my money course i make very little also but i couldnt i just couldnt stand the pressure of having a checking account and being concerned about having a check that wasnt covered because theyre really expensive down here on a you know if you if you misfigure your check you on a ten or twenty dollar check any any size check it could cost you easy fifty dollars to get it oh my God uhhuh straightened out so and my my budget doesnt have stand for that so uh but ive i save uh uh i havent the last two years i have saved in an IRA every year uh saved enough money to to buy an IRA you know to pay for a two thousand dollar IRA every year and um im in the credit union uh not the credit union the company uh savings and investment plan now thats a good idea and i save six percent there i actually save nine percent there they add three percent to it so uh im you know im uh youre set well im im saving you know i even even though i make very little money and and uh you know and me and its its me and my daughter and uh so uh you know im doing better laughternow better im came out of of a job that paid very well like for down here i made twenty five to thirty thousand a year and my ex made uh under forty and now the first year i was out on my own i made four i made twelve thousand yes it was tough and last year i got a promotion and a raise and and a better vocalizednoise different a better job and i made seventeen so uh im doing better uh and but im still saving more money now than i did when i was married yeah well i think that one thing that people dont do a lot of these days a lot of people just live from paycheck to paycheck and dont have enough to put away they do here they you know a lot of people i mean they are and every time they have uh like a car break down or their taxes come due or vocalizednoise all kinds of stuff they would our credit vocalizednoise the credit union at the company that i work for was was more like a loan shark it was awful they wouldnt they didnt have to follow uh regulations of any kind oh uhhuh and so the people would would every time they had trouble they didnt have to manage their money theyd just have to go sign their life away and and get money from the credit union and they just they ended up a lot of them ended up owing more at the credit union than they could then they could ever pay and they wouldnt get very much of a paycheck at all because of the credit union taking so much out and and they didnt werent willing to manage their their checks you know and uh but i it was pitiful i mean you think good grief yall what is your you know why but uh well i wasnt brought up this way to budget thats for sure my husband was and and it was really an adjustment period for me to learn how laughter but i could see the wisdom in it well if you exactly you know if you are not willing to budget your money then you uh you know if youre not willing to be careful and live on what you make ,family_finance,4374
 Cathy uhhuh do you so what is your uh family what do you usually do as far as budgeting we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major and we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we um you know for food and and for for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for um other things then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our needs our needs and wants list and so um the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want and um and were continually putting into those you know each month how much were going to need and then we know the month that were going to have enough to get that particular item so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for yeah my husband is a finance major also laughter and uh we kind of have the same plan um we have one credit card um every month we put um you know the same amount in for retirement um and we budget were our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so were budgeting um each month um an allowance for his education starting now so thats in our budget every month now thats the newest addition but we too do the same thing as far as um we have a set amount we take oh one big vacation a year and then maybe you know three small vacations so we have you know an exact amount that we spend on that each year um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here i see and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for um the vacation that we put in for Christmas like you have a separate account for that then vocalizednoise well a lot of that um i dont know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house oh i see uhhuh and so its actually pulled out then we keep our we have a savings account for the kidzeeskids education that money goes into there oh i see each of our children we have three children so they each have their own account i see that money is put into each month uhhuh does your husband deal in um stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff that does he invest in that and for longterm he does somewhat yeah he does somewhat um we have an investment plan yeah i guess he does but um we have really found this is the first year weve done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money really because youre youve youve sat down with a piece of laughterpaper and said well lets see what are we going to so what goes into that that particular thing its vacations Christmas Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental and um and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesnt cover rather than wondering where its going to come from we have it you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well weve got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill everythings taken care of and were finding that we even have more money than we thought really well you know um what do you do as far as i i take it do you um run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing yeah laughter i do uhhuh all the money uhhuh and how whats that all the money is turned over to me uhhuh do you have a set amount that that you spend each month or or how do you work that  i have a set amount its very generous and i usually have extra and so then that can go um you know either back into our checking account or i can just carry it over um you know there are certain months of the year that youll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over but thats completely up to me how i do that and then um because i dont work i stay home i do too i stay home also and so its kind of my money and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing we have a clothing um envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing  it really works out great were finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and were  yeah what what as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a TV or um a big item like for the house how do you have like a household yes we have a household budget like were going to need to buy a bed for my daughter thats coming out of her crib this year and also we need a new bed and so weve got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month well have enough saved to go buy those  and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards the ,family_finance,4379
 do you think should be done for the the uh huge budget we have uh uh well i think the first thing that every every time they talk about it they they say well we cant cut this or we dont need to cut this out of the budget because its such a small amount in comparison to the overall decifitdeficit deficit i think they need to start doing it i mean the taxes are going to grow so high theres no way well ever pay off what we owe now our children is going to pay it yeah i know Graham Krugman that guy Krugman was it uh Grudman hes vocalizednoise hes not going for we elected him for that uh again and he said that he didnt think that wed ever be able to have uh balanced budget laughter i dont think so they had an article in the paper here the other day about uh  the interest alone in the year two thousands going to be more than John Kennedys entire budget and when its its gone ridiculous now i dont know whats going to happen well be like California soon right or what or New York laughter bankrupt yep totally everything yeah the year two thousand that uh wed be totally dependent on foreign capital i think so like Japan i dont know if thats such a bad thing one so once Japan becomes if were dependent on them theyre most certainly dependent upon us i dont think that the world market would would be as possible for them with out us i mean i dont think Europe is consumer oriented as we are they more or less have to sell to us whether where else would you sell that many Toyotas and Hondas and stuff itd have to be here well vocalizednoise you go were the money is and if you dont have the money anymore then thats that i dont know i think the first thing we could do is uh id like to see Congress vocalizednoise attached to the decifitdeficit or you know or performance right attach performance yeah performance calls like you might have at work or or i might have too certainly do laughter laughter you do i do too uh its uh i dont know why they should be uh unregulated and and over the last twenty years weve strictly gone down hill and the salarys gone up well actually their vocalizednoise well thats one thing but we also got to change the voting stuff and the uh special interest groups and all that stuff you know we we take a lot of the blame for it we have to start voting we have to start talking we have to start uh doing something about it but were so apathetic its almost ridiculous well for one thing uh weve got lives to live i mean for us to uh to stay knowledgeable on all these issues its a full time job i mean i go to work every day just like you do i dont i cant sit down and keep up with all of this thats why we elect them oh i understand that but we have to go to vote we have to uh participate in political parties or something uh those kinds of things and we dont even do that no i i dont even think uh participation would have vocalizednoise as far as democrats and republicans go itd have to be a third party oh still i mean we have the right to do it we dont do it thats the whole problem we dont exercise those rights i dont know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean that would definitely cut down on the consumerism vocalizednoise and which really pushes a lot of the uh you know itd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment you know vocalizednoise do you sometimes think its got to a hopeless position now that theres nothing we could do to reverse it well i dont know i think if people put their minds to it they can do it its just a matter of mobilizing uh you know the people that do it its a very difficult task im not saying that any of this is easy laughter you know were were talking about numbers that i cant even comprehend vocalizednoise the numbers were too large for me well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that talking about the numbers of atomic bombs and how many times you can bomb the world over and how incredible that was and now you you know thats coming to a point where thats less likely less and less likely right economic ruling brought that down ,budget,4383
your turn oh i i start okay well uh we keep a budget to an extent um and really it it we were really forced into keeping a budget because im im paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid uh how about yourself well i have to say i really dont have a budget both my wife and i uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say and uh were both so uh frugal that um we really dont need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing yeah well i guess that really is sort of of keeping a budget you know you stay within your uh well we stay within our means but we dont do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically within your means although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um i would say rather pathological laughter uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than um um they were where i came from in uh Dallas  yeah so uh oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco that is a huge difference uh that presents um a real shock laughter actually actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since weve moved to California but but you have good sour dough and its a beautiful laughterplace to live yeah its Gods country uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it laughter um so budget is not a problem for us uh least it hasnt been it may it may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasnt been when i uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly salysalary salary for engineers that vocalizednoise in my discipline was like oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that and uh i noted at that point that i was you know if thats what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then well thats thats a system too sometimes uh its a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i dont really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose ive lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so i guess youre indirectly budgeting uh just by by the fact you said that youre both very frugal uh in spending the money so i mean thats thats a form of budgeting i would think its kind of a kind of a strange topic to to laughtertry laughterto for two people who dont really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money well i guess were both lucky in that regard then uh how big is your family uh well were we have one on the way um my wife and then were were having one on the way in uh in uh September i see so how do you and when once you get ten children though you may have laughter no i think its just going to be one oh all right laughter how about yourself i have two kids uh one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point do they budget at all i mean do you have them on an allowance or i give them uh i give them an allowance and they um i basically give my son ten dollars a week and i put half of it in the bank and i give give him the other half in cold cash and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wishes do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isnt you know burning a hole in his pocket if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually ,family_finance,4519
yeah go ahead okay well um ive never ive didnt really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast laughter um i had been working parttime before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um my budgets kind of hasnt doesnt exist except for at certain times laughter you know right and you make more money but it goes away anyway right well i dont have to worry i mean i dont have to think ahead as much like you know but i havent really saved anything im still trying to uh ive i have school debts im still paying back and stuff yeah i have three children and a house so uh its a serious its a serious matter but uh my wifes just starting to go back to work maybe thatll take the oh okay so you have to budget pressure off but i must  i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i dont ive started keeping a budget on computer i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping wouldve helped and uh i still havent managed to uh uh do it the way i should yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your moneys going then you its its easier even if you dont stick to it i think it you know its better to have you a little bit more conservative hm right i believe if i had to that i could  estimate all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but im sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan  but but even if you cant i dont think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget its because i had too i knew exactly laughterwhere every penny was going before i had it but its its a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway but also it i think its bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know youre paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes ive looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children  what youre gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and thats uh you can fool yourself if you dont set that up somehow and thats hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated dont ever you know just just blow a little bit thats you know but youll find that the  kids dont really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so theyll ask for things pretty much constantly laughter right i remember doing that as a child laughter and ive i learned to say no pretty much constantly laughter and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month id feel better about it   yeah so who knows maybe thisll get me to do it laughter  you dont have children no i sure dont well thats a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them laughter oh i know i mean ive ive had i have a cat and laughterthats laughteryou laughterknow laughter thats well thats one solution laughter thats hard enough i mean i know but i mean you know thats a lot laughter some sort of you know when some theres times when i if i couldnt afford to buy myself groceries i would buy them for her first you know just because you i mean you feel a lot worse because this being is completely dependent on you you know thats an interesting spirit but and i suppose cats are like children they dont take no for an answer laughter as easily laughter  laughter well then  uh yeah they are a lot simpler but laughter but im im just saying you know i it it would it would be hard to know that someone elses life was completely dependent on you you know  yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what theyre gonna need in five or ten years  thats uh really difficult its hard to see that right now even though you know you have too yep  well ive made my confession laughter yeah im  im glad we had this conversation because it makes me think i need to sit down and laughter maybe write ,family_finance,4594
um why dont you go ahead first okay um short term uh it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over so budgeting in the short term isnt too much of an issue because theres not that much uh extra to go around uh long term is something were starting  to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about uh gee shes eight now so i guess about ten years good heavens so were were starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement but with not a whole lot of discretionary money its kind of hard to figure out how to do it how about you thats kind of uh similar to what were doing is um budgeting you know month to month is uh kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and whats extra so thats kind of how we do it uh from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever um long term thats a little bit easier for us because uh with uh our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings K plans um that kind of vocalizednoise you know retirement plans that kind of stuff so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when its on the paycheck and you have to try and take out some of that money you always find something a little extra that youd like to get that month so uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because um its automatically taken out so uh that works out much better for us so thats kind of how we do it anyway but and the old uh if you cant see it then you cant spend it uh idea laughter laughterexactly laughterexactly and if you cant touch it you cant spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it youre going to get a penalty that kind of thing so it leads you to kind of say well im not going to take it out im going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way maybe for retirement youre going to have that money laughter left lets hope anyway so youll have that so thats kind of how we do it but ours is more like month to month too uh short term is to get things going so any way other than that uh is kind of how we do it so i dont know if were our time is up or what laughter theyll let us know laughter um theyll uh laughter yeah exactly we we actually do have some money in a K i just wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because i agree that its a an excellent way oh definitely definitely and uh it grows uh it it seems like at first youre not gonna see a big return but as the years go on if youre with the company for any length of time then it gets much better and uh so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way and theres other savings plans or other things that you can do automatic you know deposit from checks to where you dont see it and uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent its put into our savings account and we dont see it then it works out to where you know you dont look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and thats it so yeah checking accounts a very dangerous place for money to be im convinced yeah it its easy because you do spend it thats for sure like i said you know you kind of look at it uh you you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts arent the best for you know long term type of planning so and you dont get a good return on it anyway so yeah i guess there other than things like the stock market or mutual funds theres really not much of a return on anything these days exactly right now yeah its a bad time you know yeah the interest is so low i mean it its nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in CDs or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever exactly exactly you know we have some inlaws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them out of that because they got so low but uh yeah its it drops so your better bet is to uh try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh savings plan or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so yeah im im with a small company now and i hope that uh if were successful that theyll go in for some sort of profit sharing thatll be very nice oh thats great yeah well i guess were kind of running out of steam on this topic here laughteryeah laughterexactly ,family_finance,4615
 okay laughter how are you you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you laughterbudget yes yeah well i i i i feel like um i am from Mars i mean im fifty years old and uh ive been divorced for um eighteen years but ive two kids and all but i uh i ive never had a budget and i dont uh i dont do any planning and i dont know vocalizednoise i dont uh i dont have a longterm financial plan and i dont try to control my expenses but im im glad youre a stranger laughter that sounds kind of like me but really im im in a happy i i well im curious how other people live uh so maybe we should start with you laughter what do you laughterdo about the same thing  yeah oh maybe theyre going to arrest us both im even even in worse shape because i have eight children and uh we live from hand to laughtermouth we hope that theres enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if theres not then we laughtertry laughterto laughter due for the next month a couple a couple of times weve tried some things and they worked but im not disciplined enough to keep doing it the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty laughter then you didnt have any more money to spend in that area and that worked out real well cause we didnt have to keep writing down what wed spent it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money and we did that pretty successfully for about three months laughterand then we laughterstarted laughterborrowing laughterfrom laughterone laughterenvelope laughterto laughter laughterput it in the laughterother envelope and laughter in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do huh the um i had a parttime job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but i i had miscalculated i well i didnt keep a balance laughter its one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when youre only earning half the salary even though i wasnt spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning but i would forget to write the things down and it it that i i dont know if i ever went as far as three months or not laughter in in keeping that kind of data i certainly havent done that in sixteen years or whatever i even find now like with the automatic tellers ill go take money out of that and then i forget to take that out of my laughterchecking account and uh so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that whats really there and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make the uh i i i have to say that lets see at this point on i dont run out of money um and it uh and and i dont i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i dont have and i i i i think my strategy if if i may is is is is to is to not spend money i mean i dont have expensive tastes i dont go out i mean i buy a car well the last car i got rid of id had it was nineteen years old people people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and it was still running oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five Buick and it just wouldnt stop um and it i i just didnt feel the need for a new car it isnt like i couldnt afford one uh and now i mean i i dont uh i tend to eat expensive food i mean i dont mind buying a good steak but for me i only do that every week or um without even i mean maybe once a month i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so its six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids youre not going to run out and do that laughter not very often but but im just im just saying as a single person thats thats a drop in the bucket and so if youre extravagant on how you buy food it doesnt add up if youre buying mean if youre not going to super expensive restaurants which i dont care to go to thats right so so thats i think one of the reasons i dont need to budget is that i dont have i dont i dont have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i cant afford it because im not interested in that expensive thing ,family_finance,4626
what what what sort of company do you work for do you work for a big place or a little place uh i work for Georgia Tech yes sir i work for the research facility um and its its kind of small in a sense but it it does have about uh i guess two thousand civil employees and on a a scale i guess its still considered small it just have a lot of different laboratories the area i work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so so thats make up most of the laboratory so from from that standpoint its pretty small its pretty small what about yourself well i i work for uh actually probably similar kind of place i work for uh Lincoln Laboratory oh okay uh yeah we actually we do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech oh okay um and uh so were were part were actually part of MIT so its very much the same kind of place and a technical institution oh okay uh while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a and a job i guess uh some of the list i had scribbled down was the people you work with and maybe the uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that right  i dont know what are your uh what sorts of things would you consider important well those and probably the security aspect of it because a lot of time nowadays even though youre working uh youre treated and it may not be true in every place in a lot of cases i think youre treated more like a number instead of a a person because when it come down to layoff they dont really consider people and and you know their well being as far as you know how they going their next dollars gonna come in how they gonna pay them bills they just lay them off and i was reading this book one time about this guy that had uh i think the company still exists what they used to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as  opposed to just laying people off you know that way that you know one person wouldnt get one big blunt flowblow at one time and uh you know i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than something you know something like unemployment is good but i mean the company as a whole because you as an employee even though the company is making money they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth youre responsible also for helping that company get to the partpoint point that its at at making profits so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that you know because its not a persons fault that you know people not buying or binessesbusinesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know i dont see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of company a company situation now how do you mean that i know it well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that youre gonna lay off these ten people uh for the bad times of the company what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well you know in that standpoint well you you think its better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company or to yes yes i do i really do i think itd be better that way and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that you know that there are problems and you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time you know thats just thats my views you know yeah ive heard of a couple of companies that have done that i think uh back about a few years ago when things were tough Hewlett Packard did that for awhile they went to a uh a four and a half day work week rather than cut yeah just cut everybody back ten percent and uh have gave everybody a half day a week off and i think you can do that for a little while but im well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know because the way it is a person really dont have a chance ,job_benefits,4628
no you start laughter okay what are the benefits well i i mean i dont even consider like salary a real benefit it just its kind of a like a side thing im really here for you know working with lots of creative people is what i really like about my job well i think that im selfemployed and work in radio and uh for me really i dont have to be terribly concerned about uh benefits outside because i own my own company but uh the worst problem that i think uh out here is affecting people and i think would be the most positive job benefit is job security these days thats true yeah yeah you dont you dont want to have worry about it laughter you know if if youre worried you dont work as well yeah its well it its a real problem out here because uh you know its hard to imagine that you know ten years ago i can remember where we really you know somebody would work for a local company here like Kodak or Xerox which are based here and uh theyd have that job for life and you really didnt have to worry too much about that but ever since this Reagan Bush thing i know every single time theres you know the the first thing they do is they fire employees whenever theres a problem with the uh uh economy economy and clear out the employees and were losing more and more jobs and uh and it just gets worse then people dont dont spend any money yeah its its a real thats probably the biggest thing that i think people are looking for i uh put some things up in the Comp Dcom Telecom thing regularly about uh job security with the uh ATT employees and right yeah i just i just noticed that yeah the Communication Workers of America and im watching as that progresses more and more and it seems to me that were seeing a real problem with job security being the number one focus its no longer a question of salary or or perks it its just basic security to have that job yeah i know i know exactly how you feel but i i also dont know you know how how can we get people to change it i mean it it kind of it kind of requires you know a company taking a risk and they dont want to do that laughter well i in well i think maybe some incentives on the part of the government to retain employees uh versus downsizing really why were seeing that kind of downsizing is because of the uh increasing power of shareholders in the corporations of the country thats true whenever theres a uh problem with uh the economy or the stock value you know the first thing the stockholders want to see is well decrease costs which means cut employees i know i mean our CEO is is you know quite frankly stated that you know were were here to make stockholders happy and thats not why im working here laughter yeah California is really starting to feel the effects i think of the uh downturn oh definitely laughter

of telecommunications and the like out here but right laughter Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that steel mills theyre all gone theyre all in Mexico now laughter yeah were were just kind of like losing and it it just seems to be a snowball effect i mean vocalizednoise you know we keep losing more well Cupertino seems to be one of the every single software company ever sees always sees Cupertino laughteryou laughterknow so you guys at least dont have those kinds of you know the only problem software seems to be still a US strength versus hardware right and it laughter but you know the again in the future were going to see the same type of thing even in more white collar work where were going to have job security i think being the biggest focus yeah its things things arent that secure in software right now either i think its its kind of a cutthroat im also a im also a hardware manufacturer im at Apple so its like you know we we notice our product just becoming a commodity and thats really bad well i heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company were trying and if it works thats thatd be great for us but what about you know the rest of the industry yeah well the hardware you know HDTV if we can keep control of that that looks like something that we could have good strengths on and there would be a lot of new jobs created yeah although although we we go on that subject i i because i looked at HDTV uh but i i dont like standards that are on its still still on a fixed

well um preferred benefits um i worked for a large corporation in the past and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because right now im working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there and uh theres a lot of profit thats coming in but when it comes to uh small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it and uh the benefits arent as great as when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay weve got this amount of money lets put into this plan this plan you got Four O One K plans you have uh better vacation plans uh you have just in general maternity leave plans that that kind of thing big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations uh you know they just dont have the money or just uh feel that there isnt a need for it so ive worked for both big and small so ive had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the pros and cons of both well ive worked for uh well i worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile and the only they even hate to give out unemployment sure umhum at the end of tax season because they you know theyre fairly even though theyre a large scale company theyre very the offices individual offices are very small and now i work for the Framingham school teacher uh school system because im a teacher and uh we have much better benefits uhhuh sure you know in the system we have a good pension plan um let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree thats pretty good for you know being a a school district type program right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together thats extremely good yeah vocalizednoise because like like the small corporation that i work for theres no pension plan theres no type of uh savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for theres really i think youre allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a week a year its not accumulative type of sick leave um you know things like that so ive been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that ive worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health health care uh you had your insurance and you didnt have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place um they dont have as good as insurance packages as big corporations right the only trouble weve had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problem especially the retired ones my fathers retired from the town of Framingham and he said that they havent gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years no yeah yeah and he said thats the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and its sure sure hopefully will go through yeah yeah but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools isnt just the school system and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all you know is it a union uh we have the teachers union which helps out a lot but the town of Framingham pays the benefits and oh thats pretty good thats all the town workers water and sewer and where its a very large town its actually should be a city but they kept it a town um where its extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we dont have to pay a mayor laughter uhhuh yeah yeah i know what you mean and thats true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure right because most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are part time so it laughterworks laughterout laughtergood laughterbecause we reap the benefits of it and um but as far as shopping for a job id rather shop for the benefits than the salary laughter well thats it you know and and ive kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i dont think im making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large im talking like huge companies like Three M um im Honeywell uh uh Texas Instruments laughter i know people that are that have vacation times and benefits benefits that right laughter i wouldnt even dream of in this small corporation you bring it up to the owner and its like come on you know partly its because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer and and of course when its a small corporation it also wants to expand so that moneys spent in a ,job_benefits,4644

all righty okay do you have a budget that you go on yeah i sure do um i have its pretty much a ledger sheet and i just write down vocalizednoise all my bills how much im going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount umhum umhum that way i know how much pocket change im going to have left laughterat laughterthe laughterend of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway umhum umhum so that works okay for me uhhuh well my bills i usually know approximately how much theyre going to be each month they vocalizednoise are more or less just about the same you know uhhuh same here uh very seldom are they any different and then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can laughterin the kitchen and then thats what we use to buy the groceries with oh okay and then we put our receipts in there you know and usually thats enough and um but i dont have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them right luckily i dont either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually thats not so much that it would throw me off yeah yeah right in fact i did have to take my dog to the vet the other day laughterbut laughteryou so you know what im saying yeah  yeah that its its worse than having a kid huh i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing ive ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so yeah um im not working right now i worked for P I E and then uh they went bankrupt so i just went ahead and took my early pension oh uhhuh but i only get that once a month ooh thats tough yeah laughter my roommate only gets paid once a month yeah so and that last weeks pretty lean generally laughterspeaking so yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i dont go over that amount you know each month right i for for years got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once theres always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones umhum umhum but i would pay all of them at one sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it yeah right and and that worked okay for me i dont know right now i im in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is and so oh yeah right now its terrible isnt it its yeah its really bad but um its going pretty well and ive got a real good plan mapped out here so uhhuh i also like belong to a Christmas club because you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didnt then so then naturally Christmas

time but i im sure that she could pick it up again my mother always sewed she tried to teach me when i was young but not interested laughter yeah well see some people are and some people arent because i have some sisters i have three sisters and none of those are really interested in sewing yeah but thats a real good way to save money though by doing that yeah and then i can also you know do some

system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste on uh services services that arent necessary and uh outofdate ideas that just dont make sense anymore in these times yeah i i have to agree im uh right now im in Atlanta in Atlanta but i grew up and am from uh Utica New York so uh i understand and i agree with the uh New York situation situation yeah its as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent pretty much forever well theyve just decided now when our county where i am is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit uh that theyve found in the county budget here and uh you know between the increases in the sales tax and of course we have the high state tax now we have to look into the possibility of you know it if it isnt from the Bush administration with user fees its more direct taxation i dont know what the taxes are like down in Georgia well vocalizednoise its um its kind of tough to tell i havent really got no good feel for it yet the um ive been down here for only like six months so it um theyre not i dont think theyre quite as bad as they are in New York state i guess is my opinion right now um there is like there are theres a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because they dont have that up there and and other than that right now theyre starting to realize that their taxes are low but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so theyre starting to talk about um raising like instead of registering or uh getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it laughter well they just did that up here too it Mario Mario laughterraised it up here um considerably and you know weve had our road road road taxes and gas tax the gas tax was such a Utica boondoggle being from Utica you probably um remember when they put that into effect and how that was going to save our roads laughter and what it did is it all went to New York City to laughter refurbish that subway disaster laughter yeah that would of course of course no that seems like were in from New York state i guess youre youre pretty much your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow um you know taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big funnel towards New York City well yeah its you you know roads this year have been especially bad they um here in Rochester theyve now because to save tax money and that they have turned off the expressway lights at night oh yeah umhum yeah theyve been talking about doing that here too but they havent theyve almost been able to push it through but people started complaining and well they just shoved it through here and you know to hell with people and uh put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here its people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year its just were paying good tax money for this and they turned it off yet theyre still giving money to all these bizarre things in New York City the roads arent any better here and uh even the town here where i am in um the taxes have increased again i mean they just cant push property taxes any higher thats why theyre looking at this sales tax business now yeah thats down here theyre um that im amazed at the one cheap thing down here is gas im not sure what the price is up there but that down here its only like eighty nine cents per per gallon laughteroh thats not moving you know that Mario up here is were i just filled up tonight it was a dollar its a dollar fifteen nine a gallon yeah i was home over at Christmas break and it was i saw the gas prices and it was like boy what a switch well you know we also have a somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas suppliers you know anywhere else in the state its uh probably a nickel less but they say its going to increase around the summer time to a dollar twenty five up here oh sure yeah which is insane  well as soon as they get near Memorial Day people start traveling and everyone knows it so weve got to raise the gas prices oh well its its its interesting topic coming two days from tax day laughter laughteryes i know i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually small but small but uh i got it back anyway yeah were were just sitting down tonight to get ours laughterfilled laughterout were going to do it were going to do it and were going to get we were doing software to do it and then you know put off put it off put it off oh yeah now tonight laughter being two days left laughter yeah well its pretty pretty frustrating when you see the whole situation it doesnt seem as though ,taxes,4687
well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances uh the uh way way back what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all those kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it laughter umhum that sounds about right laughter you know so uh the only thing were you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spreadsheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so forth uh and i only update that oh i dont know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in you know just to see whether or not were falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying staying even or what um thats really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that were doing uh laughter well its kind of difficult for me because right now um like most teachers im laid off hm oh dear thats terrible and laughter so um i spend most you know i substitute a lot so its a lot its very hard on a nonfixed income because i dont know how many days im going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances and but i know uh how much i have to bring in a month laughter and thats about it thats about as far as we go and then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a laughterrainy laughterday oh i see are you are you married are you living with a bunch of with with people youre sharing expenses um no im a single mother i have three children oh i see uhhuh so uh right now were on we get from you know aid from the state at this point because theres no other way to do it and my exhusband just sort of took off and doesnt pay child support laughter oh dear so right now i know what im getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and um you know try to work as many days as possible any time they call me in but i still have to figure out if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid and laughterif laughteri dont work enough days then i dont get enough to meet the bills and its like a juggling act every single month like this week ive been just holding my breath and hoping theyll call me in but they probably wont because next week the kids have school vacation i see so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually dont need subs because everybodys pretty good about coming in i oh i see they dont like to be absent before a vacation oh sure but were shopping around as far as well im shopping around as far as trying to get uh thats why im doing this to get some extra money and um getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts my kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me so laughter it sort of helps defray the costs a little bit but you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul i guess were in the situation that a lot of Americans you know middle class Americans are in yeah youre the first you know uh my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these uh his company went broke oh my Lord i mean went you know bankrupt actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called US Shoe or something vocalizednoise it was a computer subsidiary i dont know what a shoe companys doing running a computer company but uh you know they just they just folded it up and um um told him to that they took the top management and gave them jobs with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office and everybody else was sent packing uh hang on one second ive got um somebody somebody was knocking on my door here um it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present stage i mean it sounds sounds terrible to say but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than than most people probably are might be terms of keeping keeping score of input and output umhum definitely do you have a computer do you have a computer at home or uh yes we do and we try to you know i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in you know every single day im at the computer i see and its like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasnt come in yet you laughterknow yeah have you do you use a standard uh a standard spreadsheet or i mean ,family_finance,4688
 not very laughtergood laughterits laughternot laughterbeen laughtera laughtergood laughterday i went  i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon i dont know i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn so i hope shes turned it in laughter are you eating i just  go ahead ill stop eating i just barely got home from the university i just barely got home from the university no its okay say what tell you what we can do is uh i can punch the uh one then we after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want laughter laughter okay go ahead fire away uh i love the irony of uh talking about this subject on April the fifteenth but um im afraid im im im probably in the minority i i actually dont think that we uh pay too much in this country um um particularly uh in this part of the country where um i guess i agree with you i do have a uh a bone to pick with um uh the way taxes are distributed um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal form and the sales tax cant i think thats regressive and uh its kind of dumb i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but then on the other hand i dont mind that its only on you know things that arent like  groceries and that its not on them well i mean nobody taxes groceries do they where oh yeah they do in Arizona is that right we have a pretty low income tax i mean pretty low tax rate here oh i think that the sales tax they just got to do something about it right its but thats the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes right  but i guess when i hear when when i see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven you know if you compute it as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well theres theres theres no other country thats that is taxed as low as we are well and i still think having lived in Europe for awhile you know  the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it im im not sure i understand what you mean well i mean i think i was in Germany you know for several years  and id a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have than have to live there  oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher uh yeah i suppose thats true yeah um probably more less so now than it was ten years ago or whenever but higher taxes yeah still is that way to some extent  i think the other problem is you know its its easy to complain about taxes because theyre something you theoretically can do something about but i look for example and you youre not in the quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world i wish i didnt have to pay  any more for for to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes yeah since uh i send my kids to parochial school thats uh yeah that thats probably a little tougher on you its not its not quite the bargain that laughtera laughterguy laughterwould laughterthink  but i mean i pay them gladly thats a decision i think its a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money but uh i mean thats uh thats the way the Americans want to interpret it i guess thats all right but yeah i and if i were uh when i was single and again when im retired i will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good thats always been a high priority you know no i think thats just you though i do think yeah thats true i think in places i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun they people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they cant get the tax bill passed no matter what happens and uh  there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they cant get anything done that seems um um like a cultural lapse i mean people were always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they of course i think with the graying of America were gonna see that problem in lots of places right yeah people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools laughter because it means more to them but i think its sad or build roads selfish and shortsighted yeah ,taxes,4707
 okay what would you rather have or you want salary too plus what whats most important to you as far as tangible benefits go i would say that uh health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs umhum well ill tell you i think that is the most important thing laughter ive uh im not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for  excuse me i had health benefits you know dental vision all that pension plan um now i dont have that although i do have a pension that im drawing from them which thank God i had but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important uh you you really dont realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your of your compensation package right um i should knock on wood i havent you know had any serious health problems or anything ive only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since i  left work and it was only for a cold you know and they cant really do anything for you anyhow so you might as well not even go laughter yeah they look at you say well youre still breathing so uh yeah yeah right laughter oh youve got a cold go home and take uh liquids and uh rest laughter but um that is definitely the most important um pension i guess is next um thank God that i had one i dont know what happened to the salary employees when uh the company went bankrupt but i was union so mine was being put into a like a trust fund you know so but i dont know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs or i suspect that it just disappeared yeah thats what i was thinking too i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there you know so where what company do you work for um i work for a little startup company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Arc um um umhum have you heard of them they we do uh distributive system software umhum umhum for Unix based workstations no i i worked for a trucking company P I E nation wide you probably heard of that laughter ah yes yes fact my mom drives trucks so oh does she really oh how about that so yeah i see uh after the merger uh you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road well you did so did did Ryder get out of the business is that what happened or well Ryder and P I E went together you know and then then that ended it ah so that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing it really did its it started i think a little bit before that but that when P I E and and Ryder went together why it was downhill from then on you know yeah and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time but when when the company goes bankrupt i mean the theyre just cut off completely and youre responsible for your own and and thats exceedingly expensive yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits we could do that for eighteen months but three hundred and fifty dollars a month God thats terrible its definitely excessive you know so but anyhow uh and jobs arent that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits you know and a lot of them that if you do get a job they dont pay benefits yeah theyre starting to to cut back especially startups i know here at Trans Arc we get uh we get health care and thats it and theres no dental or vision and the the shortterm disability policy is is a ninety day policy and there is no long term disability policy so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there umhum umhum and you know of course they can use the excuse well were a startup yeah right but you know whats happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God theres been big articles in the paper about that uh you know they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and theyre lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know so i dont know whats happening and whats going to happen but uh well that certainly doesnt help matters any i mean you you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits such ,job_benefits,4709
okay well so what im sorry go ahead laughter what what kind of benefit uh benefits do you have at work well i im i work at a large company and uh we have quite a quite a few benefits and uh we have um the best benefit i like is the uh amount of uh vacation time especially after uh working working there for a long time it really build up to the amount of vacation time i i think thats one of my best benefits oh yeah is there a something that you wished you had that you dont or  well one thing that i i uh wish uh in a big company theres more bureaucracy and uh less support of uh what youre doing i think and uh thats something that um is uh probably and a benefit of a smaller company you get more support from the the people that you work for yeah i work for a relatively small company were a trade association for credit unions and uh our benefits are fairly good and like you say that support i mean you work directly with the president and the executive vice president and you know they you get the feedback from them directly and i like that but i wish i really the thing i like i guess i wouldnt mind having a better retirement plan we have just a defined benefit plan and i kind of would like the idea of having a K or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions thatd be a lot better i thats one thing i wish i had a little bit more of but youre really thinking of the future uh yeah i i dont know im kind of the type i just dont wanna work my whole life id rather be able to make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before and so thats and thats one way i can see doing it but none of them i work i work for the state of Florida and uh its pretty good retirement plan we dont get paid very much but uh retirement plan is pretty pretty good works good yeah thats like i say ours were we get uh vacation is pretty good too i mean its you get a week after the first year two after the second three after the third and it goes up just every year by a week up until i think like six years which is a lot better than anybody else id ever heard of uh yeah thats quite a bit of vacation to have after six years service so did you say you work for a credit union uh it its a a credit union league theyre kind of a trade association for credit unions we uh kind of do a lot of the uh political support and stuff like that for the credit different credit unions within the state yeah my wife used to work for a credit union group they magazine they had a newsletter that went out to all the oh did she all the uh credit union CEOs and people like that so she was really into the keeping up on whats going on with the credit unions oh really huh what what did she work for uh it was it was a company um i think it was called Credit Union News or something it was based out of uh i think it was Boca Raton Florida oh really yeah that sounds pretty familiar to me yeah it was pretty uh but uh pretty glossy kind of uh newsletter that comes out well uh  do you get to i dont know have you heard of any people that kind of do this uh the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose what kind of benefits you get or  uh not too much is that something that Florida does or where your work the state of Florida or you pretty much get what they give you and yeah just i get what what you give in uh thats uh not not uh with not too many choices yeah i guess a lot of the more uh some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them more because whatever you know men and women alike they give them say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but and if they whatever they dont use they get in cash but a lot of companies dont like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other wont so it saves the company money whereas this one you know youd end up paying regardless yeah i guess but for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea but anyway i havent uh havent got so fortunate as to get into any of those companies yet okay well well hey it was good talking to you all right see you later byebye okay bye ,job_benefits,4718
i think um uh actually im uh fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation and for me theres absolutely no question whats the most important laughterbenefit  i think its health care its what i think everybody would say that oh and then if you try to get it outside of your uh corporation youre gonna pay an arm and a leg right belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you  um so the um  sometimes i think its more important laughterthan salary uh do you also get dental yes and um i dont know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental can dental expenses can really kill you oh i know now my husband is with uh Northwest Airlines and he gets uh you know the full health and dental and uh we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous and i dont know how people that dont have it can afford it right its uh or maybe they dont laughter  right uh and then uh um if the cleaning doesnt get you the orthodontics will thats laughterright thats right laughter uh i guess that would be up there uh im not sure if i would rank uh how i would rank that next to say compared to retirement or uh um pre tax savings was another thing that i think is a a great a great benefit when i  and i really i think its really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how were not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan well its a lot easier to to save it when you dont get your hands on it first right when you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldnt otherwise do and uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the uh corporation for example uh  oh yeah do they have even have do they have father leaves or anything like that  you know i i dont think so yet they may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take uh i their uh i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short oh i do too uh uh i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks oh i think i think its just a crying shame uh for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks right and and uh she isnt recovered laughter and uh the infant needs her desperately at that point and time there vocalizednoise there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time right i agree its uh its so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up oh sure especially in this day and age you dont want to start over again anywhere yeah youre right i think youve put your finger on the one benefit that i that i would most like to see uh changed  um the uh parental leave well i think theyre at theyre coming theyve come a long way um at least some companies some of them uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency and uh as manager and uh uh they have a very very poor leave policy and uh i just dont know how how women do it particularly single parents who dont have the support at the other end  they do it by shortchanging their kids there no other way thats right thats exactly right i mean uh unless theyre part of some extended family which is unlikely um with people moving as much and uh theyre just its just a terrible choice you shouldnt have to make it uh  right and uh  but one of the benefits we get of course is travel laughter oh right boy would i like to have that laughter its wonderful laughter the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you cant afford to stay once you get there laughter laughter oh listen i have friends in a lot of different cities if youd just fly me there ill take care of that laughter laughterthats laughterright laughter you have to have an awful lot of fun just just getting there is has to be half the fun laughter so  and uh i guess the uh the idea ,job_benefits,4720
 regarding uh taxes im you know taxes are really a necessary evil in in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because you its more efficient to do things yourself right hm and uh and so as as a result uh you know its its a tradeoff you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really dont deserve it uh well yeah laughter i know its its a lot you know that uh that i feel like you know just like you said that it theres just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you dont need the money for but theyre giving it to other people that dont really need it either either but yet they accept it well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know  vocalizednoise look vocalizednoise look look for uh look for people to uh take care of me and uh probably a good woman right  like so many people do laughter  laughterright laughter just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and then and and then you dont have to be on the tax roll but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing and everybody everybody really hates it it was very timely i i i always over pay my my deductions so i wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding so uh you know that thats always a smile but of course you know ive ive paid it in and i should calculate it better laughter you are you in business for yourself no i i i i work for the FBI okay i see so i im a federal employee yeah guess i dont sound like it huh laughter uh well i think i no i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know most of them vocalizednoise unless you work for Internal Revenue laughter yeah ive blown yeah oh i ive got all four feet in a trough you know being a federal employee and and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue you know i vote no on every one of them im i but but but this isnt this is tax not tax revolt country i mean theres too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know plus our snout right up to our ears so you know its not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation but uh um now the um the local taxes here i i in in this particular area um you know ive uh i think i pay about uh oh thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money and and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and and they theyre building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where its cheaper at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars im paying in taxes why i i i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right yeah thats right for you know instead instead its its the taxes here so course i dont know whether i wanna go to Bulverde or not yeah or Seguin or someplace like that but uh theres certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and i and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer if youre not gonna use them then you wanna be in in an environment thats a strategy i think that that the people you know have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living you know and im im five six away vocalizednoise years before im eligible to retire and and im saying well you know i really cant stay here uh as a retiree its too expensive after you retire yeah yeah yeah im gonna have to go out in and you know in  you know East Fork someplace and and and do my thing you know oh my parents are in the same situation you know they their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesnt feel like he can retire because they couldnt pay the taxes and they have no children in school or you know anything now they dont use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know and theyre not doing it again again you know so well its certainly uh uh you must be a TI employee uh yeah you must be what you must be a TI employee no im not laughter no i i dont work im a student i go to school im in nursing school youre not a TI employee who do you work for youre vocalizednoise ,taxes,4725

 he uh well do you use a budget uh i do at times off and on right now im probably in one of the more the more off times any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you oh it works fine its just i i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then you know theres no more uh i mean you know then its work to catch up uh you know then the two or three times where ive got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it and you do stick by it when you do it huh yes how about you well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatevers left over i spend you know i just laughter that just kind of seems to be the way it works the budget i stuck on the most pardon me was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh uh longterm savings twenty percent goes toward uh basically shortterm you know doing going out to dinner like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know something something a little little more shortterm than like the longterm budget and then the other and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first youre more likely to stick with it yes and i know that that theory unfortunately neither im married married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of selfcontrol in the world and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh well save it this month well think well oh gee well buy this lamp or this whatever you know so uh our savings our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain but are you married uh i will be a week from next Monday oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way no not really have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now weve still got our own money really and thatll probably itll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something in which case you know its very convenient to once again throw everything together well i agree its uh maybe for us anyway its easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it right right but uh but we just kind of started out that way and yeah and and right now in my case its more situation that uh that she uh uh has still got a lot of debt and its easier for me to kind of like just shoulder the normal stuff and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt well thats a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married laughtertoo well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didnt like it uh no its not a whole lot of fun i think its people in general yeah you have a tendency thats a tendency to do it when you can one of the ways i insure my longterm savings is the fact that you know ive got a K plan so ive got uh five percent of my income going into that uh thats actually five percent before taxes uh that could you know so thats even more and then ive also uh uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check youll think oh well i just wont put anything or you know even if its of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway im sure but once it goes into the checking account its awfully hard to transfer it over right well ive ive even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month thats a good idea you know once again you know you know its there you know its going to happen its a uh an easier way to uh to save and uh your fiancee is shell she goes along with the savings part too even though uh shes managed to get herself into debt no she has no saying laughter laughter but youre going to manage to make her stick to your plan right well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but i i think until you know were were both growing vocalizednoise because you know of that i think itll probably stay away for awhile well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts thats the way they prefer it uh you know uh she doesnt go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but its everybody as long as i think uh your ,family_finance,4804
 do you have any thoughts on company benefits i do but uh theyre pretty slanted i want you to know laughter im prepared laughter uh my company was bought by another company and the majority of us were laid off oh okay i see where this is laughtergoing uhhuh so you know uh what i would like to see well uh the really sad part of this is that im fifty five years old thats not that laughterbad beg your pardon thats not so sad oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim i was a systems analyst for an oil company and you know they just i mean Sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean im sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications for this type of work you know its just uh and i guess thats thats pretty farfetched as benefits go but gosh you know i saw it i was fixed for life laughter so uh i think more and more people are finding that out even people with state and and uh federal jobs it its a shock it really is it really is but uh i i think uh i guess my feelings on this are that the one of the most important benefits we currently have is our health insurance thats true and that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company isnt there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for eighteen months there is uhhuh and and thats fine but you know im still unemployed after about fourteen months okay oh yeah thats worrisome and when you switch yeah when you switch over the the premiums are really quite high and additionally ive had a heart attack so its going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now now with the political political situation the way it is i think thats going to change you talking about national health i think were going to have to have something of that sort so that will cease to be as important a benefit i think that well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are what are your feelings what what do you feel suing left and right and just driving these costs up well i agree with you but do you know thats thats what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates well i i have my own beef about health insurance i uh im not a spring chicken laughtermyself quite frankly um i raised a family and now id like to get back into my field which is teaching and its at a time where school budgets are so far down that theyre firing experienced people and also you know im im a art teacher which is a very small field out of a whole school theres two or three oh yes and you know there are two hundred apliplationsapplications for one one job uh you send in a resume and they they dont even write a letter to you to say no thanks which they they dont have time yeah i suppose and um i do substitute teach and my biggest complaint is schools get a discount insurance school districts because they have so many people why cant they allow their substitutes to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have and they wont let us well youve youve approached it yeah they dont let you do it what is their thinking on it uh um i dont know i dont know have they said i just i just know its not allowed okay have they said we cannot do this because yeah uh no not they they didnt get that far no because no because we we do we dont do this we dont do this and everybody thinks its sort of a crying shame i have been divorced and i knew that uh when i was divorced i was allowed that eighteen months of insurance on my exhusbands plan and i was allowed to pay for myself at their lower rate and i dont see what the school district would have to lose by letting us pay for ourselves but is uh lets see are they paying a part of the premium well i theyre paying all the premium for their fulltime teachers oh they are yeah yeah thats part of their salary and have you offered to come in and have you offered to come in and pay the whole premium and they still wont let you no no its just not policy thats crazy yeah that just doesnt seem to make any sense so what do you do about insurance well i am remarried now and my husband um quit his job to try some consulting hes an engineer and what he did was he joined you know if you join a group sometimes its a little less he joined the Engineers Society or some group like that and what he did which was actually very clever most people want to have ah yeah the lowest deductible and then get eighty percent of their money back and all of this my husband said why dont we take a five hundred dollar deductible if we have a little you know annual checkup here or there we can pay that thats not the problem ,job_benefits,4811
 see when when when youre with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pays regular but uh well you know sometimes you dont get tuned in to whats going on and i i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know whats going on and maybe thats thats probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do whats whats your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company well since im kind of on the the older side you know i i i just feel like uh when i start talking about benefits i talk about im concerned about medical benefits  my um my husband works for McDonald Douglas and so my his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know thats really great you know i work for um Western a bank Western Financial and uh they dont let me know really about anything thats going on even some of the immediate things that i need to know i dont know it until the next hour and then all of a sudden we know weve gotten changes made were changing departments were changing policies were changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing i mean i feel like if i i dont necessarily need to uh be involved since im pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know im pretty much on a low level as far as uh uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know whats going on and whats happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line well that i i well i i work for the government and uh actually i work for the FBI oh my gosh and uh and so well you know we we dont theres lots of things that we dont get told for good reason but uh but basically uh theres lots of things that that we should know about projects im an engineer you know im im a COTR and sometimes and i worked in the same lab with a guy and we didnt really know that much about each others projects for two years and we shouldve you know were were now collaborating laughter and it didnt for two years we didnt and which which was uh kind of stupid and it it but uh but uh our organization is doing something else tomorrow on Monday uh were having a for all unclassified programs were were having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways and everybody all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting and but yeah that is interesting but uh but that sort sort of thing but but if but just i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand whats going on and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know and you know if you dont really count if youre not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesnt impact you directly or if your management doesnt think that but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties was is keeping a job until you retire hm ah right uh and engineers are uh  are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies and uh its very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy im getting more money and im getting more responsibility im doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon youre the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree and pretty soon somebody falls off ive ive fallen off twice in my private sector and uh laughter and and you know i can get up i know it it seem to be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of um see my sons eighteen right now and he hes uh he wants to go into engineering and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now is kind of open and hes interested in basically three different areas but uh its difficult for me to  to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course investigation and and see what he can do because who knows whats going to happen in another thirty years umhum yeah and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical i mean my um brotherinlaw is like um i mean hes sixty hes not ready to retire but his company is is closing is um is uh closing up and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on hes getting cut back and hes not ready to retire yeah he may be retired ,job_benefits,4831
 okay uh laughter well we just got our income tax return and im perfectly happy what about you laughter well lets see um i havent gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the Bay area so im not sure how much im getting back but im pretty sure should get back a little bit since im still a student so not too much not too bad though but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think its pretty high but i im uh you know i i guess thats where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that that we have and yeah it its one of  those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but uh although it is kind of a pain sometimes though its just scary though about you know how high are the taxes gonna be when my children are my age you know that thats thats scary too because its not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child so you know that thats a scary part too that you have to think about yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because were vocalizednoise were increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex and you know taxes are one of the ways that help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society i mean everything from you know from Medicare to um to Social Security to um to feeding the homeless to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that and its now theres more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and you know its its becoming a a large responsibility but someone someone has to pay for it and thats us yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know the taxpayers are your money is your money going to where you want it to go and theres gonna be a special this week i i cant i cant remember if its Twenty Twenty or one of those things where um i think its one of the local news i think theyre having an a documentary something about that about theyre trying to catch some people about not spending your tax pay monies right and fraud and that kind of thing you know and thats kind of scary too and uh so that would be interesting to see i wanted to see that program yeah and and even even today its like you know theres still a considerable amount of taxes that you know were paying for but youd think that were still in this this this uh deficit state that were still not able to pay off things just because i laughterknow the budgets not big enough as it is and makes you wonder when theres vocalizednoise you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher you know its like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that thats kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesnt come down to that yeah laughter but on the other hand they also while while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and its good but its its the price they pay laughter i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically its actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and dont try and generate a larger um a large amount of revenue because theres so little um currency flow through out the economic system you sure do know a lot know a lot laughter uh just keeping up with the times thats all yeah yeah as it as it turns out you know its one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because well its nice to know that when im actually you know i do start working that ill like to know like where my tax dollars are going too vocalizednoise i work hard to to get you know i like to know where its going to thats true what do you think about these items that are gonna be um taxed even more like um tobacco and that kind of thing i think in a in a way its good in a way its not um but i think in general its probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past um have been not taxed because theres been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies and its things like tobacco are um theyre theyre a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers and its as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example theres an ordinance which states that um theres no smoking in any public areas and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel theres no smoking allowed anywhere oh really ,taxes,4840
well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and laughter as it may be is to first of all put an end to these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh um other types of uh tricks that have been used to help mask the size of this thing lets get a hold of what the real true sized of it is and then lets deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible even if it means some short term higher taxes to get it down and uh then lets try to make some reforms with the the congressional community ha ha laughter try and make it so that we dont have this problem in the future well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor a situation where the revenue generation activities of the government such as the IRS are monitored and spending for year X plus one can go no higher than the revenues brought in during year X you know so that uh forget about this balanced budget this would immediately force them to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and weve only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh i realize that im off by a factor of about five but laughter we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million i i just keep seeing unfortunately the problem a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people bought into this notion that well we can just uh we dont need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and the deficit doesnt seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what its going to affect your kids yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead  vocalizednoise well i i think this has always been the case with the American public in that its made up of a bunch of special interest groups its only recently that special interest groups have started to exert more power uh for instance retirees theyve started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net but its not that way anymore uh now youve got people who have uh sixty thousand in tax free income because they invested wisely during their working years and theyre still collecting social security and all of that money is tax free im sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable and the thing is that you should loose social security benefits based on how much income you have yeah the only the only problem comes down as that a lot of people will scream and yell especially the AARP because they were yelled that well we paid for this all along was this a hidden secret tax the whole time thats our money that they dont want to give back to us now vocalizednoise uh yeah i i i i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh vocalizednoise tax and thats what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh uh you know i mean theyre treating it as a tax theyre treating the money as tax revenue its not something that theyre putting aside for later use it goes into the general fund whether or not it wants to to go there thats thats were it goes and its being used so i mean um uh my personal opinion out here in California we just instituted term limits on the uh Senate and House for the state legislature and i dont know whether its going to have uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my God you know youre going to have a bunch of amateurs running the state legislature well well so what laughter they cant do any worse than the guys that are in there now and vocalizednoise well yeah we have that out here in New York too you know with governor Mario King Mario and the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know laughter well i think that what we may end up with with the term limits is you get more people involved in government you get more people seeing how it should work and i think what that will do is that will allow people to say well wait a minute weve got to compromise weve got to work on something we need more of a vision and less of uh God ill grab my money and do everything i can ,budget,4843
 were supposed to talk about if we agree on if were paying too many taxes or if were getting our monies worth out of the taxes we pay right i think its kind of a loaded question i dont think anybody would say we should pay more laughteri laughterthink i think most of us feel that we do pay enough yeah i think here in Texas theyre even running an ah a series right now on the news one of the news channels at night about they were like secretly um supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county here and they were hired by the state state so they were being paid with our tax money  and they werent even doing the job they were out working on other sites not doing a thing on what they were supposed to do  well i i think whats happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them theyre entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because theyre protected by their unions etcetera uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in im i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didnt like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do so i would just back off but and you know thats what it seemed like from the inside um its not that no one works i think what happens is its a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders who dont do it i think i i you know i think its a cross section of humanity its not so much all state workers i mean its hard to generalize like that yeah i think that we pay enough taxes and i think that if if everybody would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money if we could somehow get the same um ability to get work done and and be honest about it with our tax dollars i dont think they need to raise it and i think theyd be able to handle with what weve got i feel like here in Texas we pretty much get our monies back out of what we pay i feel very pleased with what they do theyve put in you know as far as the state taxes go i dont know about our federal money i think thats all pretty laughter i hope that theyre doing better with not spending so much more than what theyve got but you know you just never you cant control that but in the state here theyve put in bike trails theyve got really nice parks here in Texas they keep their their their lots that they own that are green and stuff they keep them really nice um their schools here are really good and updated theyve got computers in the schools im very pleased at least with the area that were in with how they spend their money their their they dont tax us outrageously and they seem to really give us a lot for our tax dollars they offer community classes for our kids to go to that are just very minimal minimal costs you know just cover the instructor and um there lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of there are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing um they just offer so much for i feel like what we pay in our taxes that i dont mind paying them at all apparently theres been a uh movement where i am im on Long Island which is a suburb of New New York City and um theres been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and theres all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of assume at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private University and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and five like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class theyre so over crowded they cant get in the class  yeah so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class that this this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well thats thats an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they dont speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent and and i heard that thats true i mean thats i find that incredible thats a vocalizednoise so youre not as pleased with your tax dollars and what theyre doing in New York uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um argument argument with them im a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and id like to work fulltime and theyre firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down maybe its not handled real efficiently you know thats thats very likely vocalizednoise that could be i dont know um my you know my husbands in the computer business and the schools just you know theyre updating computers are the hot new thing and

very organized person that believes i ought to have all those things and we dont uhhuh so you its not just you you have a family yes im married i have two kids um young four and a half and three and vocalizednoise as far as sitting down and putting a formal budget paper and pen you know and following it no we dont do that um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and cant spend and you know so it its not like we just totally dont have a clue as to whats going laughteron but i wish we were a little more organized a little more you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about faithful to a budget but we dont have a budget where it says its so much for this and so much for that but we do put a certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the mortgage and the electric bill and all that and i know theres a certain number i put on my grocery and pocket money and sometimes i have a little left over and i kind of put it away but the next week i pull it out and add it to that number and i know that i dont go above that and i know that when we empty out the mortgage and the electric bill money and all that that you know you got to stop laughterspending but you know i i dont know if i can say i guess with the grocery and pocket money i do have a particular number but thats right thats right you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if somethings going to break and youre gonna need more thats right well its very difficult my husband is in is selfemployed hes in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions its very hard to sit down and budget because you dont know what hes going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there but theres months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and theres some months he doesnt bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall and so you kind of have to you know i have in in my mind i know the basics i know what weve got to meet each month you know and and my salary helps towards that because mines set you know but um i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that wed like to do if i did follow a  you know pencil and paper budget but do you folks get to save  well differently i mean do i have a savings account sitting in the bank no but uh we do have you know universal life insurance on him we have um a K a CODA plan preretirement plan on me through my work uh so there are things that we have money invested in you know i have a profit sharing and pension uh savings more toward retirement now savings sitting at the bank that hey lets plan a vacation no when we decide we wanna do something like that we start saving for that and when we get it we go right you know cause i im finding more and more that people dont have so many dollars left after they spend on what they have to spend i i think its the rare person who says well im just putting money away for my kids and and every week puts in fifty dollars or something i dont i think people arent having much left at all nowadays i think its more and more difficult i do have savings accounts for my kids at work and um and i use that for their uh life insurance investments uh but i also pull from that and from mine if we need the money you know if you need it for something or like you said the something comes up on the house and youve got to have it well you go deplete those funds laughterand laughteruse laughterit you know right that come from somewhere yeah i work part time im a substitute art teacher so you know we try to live on my husbands salary and when i want something frivolous that he probably wouldnt agree to i just you know spend laughtermy laughterown laughtermoney or chip it in when you know something big comes up thats true yeah now we have an interesting arrangement my husband loves golf and im glad he has i mean its his release its his time each week where hes not dad and hes not husband and hes not employee and he you know what im saying its just a release i thought you said when hes not dead laughter not dad laughter laughterwell jeez laughter and no dad laughter dad laughter not dead laughter ill have to work on that uh and and im glad he has that im glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf  i dont particularly have anything i like to do from week to week or day to day or or anything like that and thats fine um and so what i started doing and hes never said you know if i wanted something id look in the checkbook because im to practical and say nah id better not spend the money well hes never held me back you know hes always said if you want something go get it but i didnt feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit union at work and i save for something i want because ,family_finance,4891
 okay  uh i just currently quit my job and so i really dont receive any benefits right now laughter laughter laughterright but my husband does and um i think one of the um my first of all always salary and second the second thing is um because we have children so itd be um health benefits and medical benefits and and um right now we have yeah yeah definitely probably some excellent benefits right now we have with Aetna and uh i dont know if youre familiar with them but were real happy with them yeah yes ive had a variety of different jobs with of various types um in the computer field and so seen a variety of different types of benefits um ive worked for for vocalizednoise for awhile and they are you know really um an academic type of place and then ive worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff so ive seen a wide range of both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care thats either fully or partially paid and you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much of other types of benefits and so yeah i would id say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um and thats one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about taking changing jobs is you know you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me yeah yeah um and i guess support for whatever whatever other you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work um because ive been at places which offer a lot of support and others that dont offer any and some that sometimes thats coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so thats not so bad um you know its kind of a give and take kind of thing i think um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just losing you know losing all your salary cant laughtercant laughtereven begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something um and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices laughter and who to go with and that really helped us out a great deal but my husband does get vacation and its worked out really good for us too so  but yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because that makes a big difference my wife works part time and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and so two days a week i um manage to get home early enough to meet the kids from the bus  because she works you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon till close um so we have vocalizednoise  well thats great that yall can work that out thats really good yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldnt there wouldnt be anyway to do that at all and i think its kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because i mean usually you know you go to work before theyre awake or as theyre getting up for school and you get home and its already dark unless its summer time you know and even if its summer sometimes you get home so late that theres you know you cant do anything with them and especially in the winter i mean you get get up in the dark and come home in the laughterdark laughteryou laughterknow its like its like a vampire laughtersometimes yeah its that same with my husband because hes got pretty flexible hours if as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do with thats worked out really well for us too well is there anything else that you look for or um a lot of it to i guess is you hit pretty you put a lot of the main points in yeah i think some it is how the uh you know i guess its not really a direct benefit but how you um performance is rated and stuff like that at work because ive been uh especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting having you know real problems ive found out ive worked for a few you know several thousand plus  you know type companies and it especially if youre doing like professional work where there you know its kind of  ethereal as to what youre doing you know if youre like ive i work with uh computer systems a lot so its kind of hard to say you know if youre a you know brick layer somebody can look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didnt fall down  you know yeah you did a great job if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or if especially if you write like papers you know or do design studies or something its real hard to rate something like that its like being a painter or you know or something an artist its like well jeez how do you really rate you know Michelangelo you know  how would you tell if he was you know really good or  soso or whatever baside no easide and that does make want a person want to

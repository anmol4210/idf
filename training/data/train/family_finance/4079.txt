okay so Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have well uh i dont know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh my wife uh has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month right thats thats sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have laughter im single so i guess uh i dont know if thats an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically really dont need to laughter right i dont need to laughter im the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier thats right um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh i kind of i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i im pretty consistent from month to month and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes im pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it well i found that uh you know things as as ive gotten older im in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh you know we we planned out how much were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know will come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount ive got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month ill just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in ive got that much set aside and i guess thats a way of budgeting yeah thats i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium uh medium or longer range i just have a maybe a target amount that ill save for like im probably within a year id like to buy a new car so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and im making every effort to to vocalizednoise put a little bit away and you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for for keeping them on the road too you know weve got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so were on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know im constantly making car payments but i figure thats got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually im saving up for another one besides so you you know its its kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that uh youre only youre not paying for two at the same time i guess what im saying have you thought about uh leasing well ive thought about it but leasing wouldnt i you know i dont use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so i see but if youre rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that yeah i guess uh you know typically you vocalizednoise if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself yeah youre right um i i have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them you know thats right laughter yeah mines uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had expenses a number of expenses but uh im hoping that most most of them were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year and im hoping ill be have a slow period before i need that again laughter those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know its nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say so that it doesnt uh kill you all in one month right what line of work are you in

 topic today theres a sound like a panel topic were talking about uh what we can do to make uh make uh our government get a little more for its money in other words vocalizednoise short and long longterm goals yeah vocalizednoise short longterm goals to be able to get a better value out of what we already pay and i wanted to say something to you about Ross Perot are you familiar with the man uh ive ive watched him yes hes vocalizednoise hes ive been told that that he uh well his ideologies wont work because hes too much of an authoritarian yeah but he does raise some interesting points like he does i i i from just his speaking i i i hear a a very a strong tinge of integrity uhhuh the uh the the question he raised in my mind was uh he was speaking in front of the National Press Club the other day and he said vocalizednoise lets think of some wild and crazy things to do to wipe out the four hundred billion dollar deficit that weve got um vocalizednoise remember were thinking about wild and crazy things well throw anything out he said um lets say we take all the profits of the fortune five hundred for a year not enough money only half as much as we need so another words four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money uh and thats just he deficit just this year theres apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the presidents own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement i think that would be the shortterm goals get rid of the fraud and mismanagement um apparently they have plenty of time the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well its going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me but are we what do you think are we talking about the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think its the human element its a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help exactly yes could help track oh sure uh and and find out whats going on you know statistical crossreferencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know they do to keep in office to stay in office uh i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we dont limit congress critters at all i think Dave i think one of the another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also we the American people dont have faith in the government and they dont have faith in business yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they uh its something that everyone can identify with and and uh if they cant even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from GM and theyre theyre making four and five times theyre making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year um oh that GM is trying to market their products and is that thats another way is that the consumers just dont trust big business they just dont theres so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and theyre just going whats this yeah i think um its uh ive been studying some libertarian views and ive been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of out of business and away from business and out of everybodys hair you know i i i mean i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with democracy with you know our capitalistic government the almighty dollar doesnt have any ethical code with it and i its just like how you know what would you do the Exxon Valdez you see what what are we just just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because the in the our capitalistic society its just those controls its just its the business it starts going and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and were polluting something unfortunately

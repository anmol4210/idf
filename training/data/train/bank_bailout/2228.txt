 okay all right uh feelings on what caused the S and L  i guess i dont have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where loan were made that appear to be a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued umhum kind of like a dominos effect right i i dont have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever no no uh i vaguely recall but ive never gone and and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i dont have a real since of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour umhum no i dont think it was really corruption that caused it or within i think people just started you know not not being as careful with the loans that they were making you you know whenever they gave them out i think maybe they didnt check into them enough or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed its sort of well no skin of my back ill move on to this other company or umhum umhum i i just since that they didnt have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i dont know whether thats because they had other opportunities to which they could move umhum  you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didnt werent stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on  im not sure or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didnt they didnt care any more i i just im rather puzzled about the whole thing laughter umhum i know well laughter im um i know a little bit about it but i dont as much as i should know about it im a finance major here at Clarion and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think thats kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it well they didnt they didnt have a since of risk no i dont think so oh okay and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know theyre limited to the types of loans that theyre allowed to make and i think the S and Ls were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i dont think this would have happened well do you think we theres a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and nickels but do you think theres accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is or is there more to be heard yet  i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it laughterwasnt making it wasnt as good news as it was i think its still adding you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile so you dont think necessarily they dont have a complete grasp yet of the problem or whether it vocalizednoise no i dont i dont think they do i dont think how i dont think how they could find that big vocalizednoise you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and Ls still open and its and its very possible for them to go down in the future because of this to be caught in the land slide do you think to possibly is that itll happen with the the regular banks i i dont know i think i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it it seems that i recall reading for the last oh lets say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans i have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost  oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just reading i think it was in Venezuela i cant remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back you know and they just they just wrote it right off i think i think weve lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back its impossible to get it back and so you think that its just gone umhum yeah because were were you know were talking about some companies that have just like even gave up on getting it back theyre even trying any more they just totally wrote it off their book do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors which i dont think is what it was meant to do so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exists for for these sorts of of problems umhum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing um it its just its just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um yeah vocalizednoise as long as theres enough little companies were going to have to have something so your since is that the that uh the the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money and given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected and that is its million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of of dollars being protected it it seems like um  there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts uh its if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion billion dollars and were taking about monies way in access of that now so its obvious that weve protected large accounts and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought  yeah you know that the for i guess im content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes its on an individual basis someone whose got accounts in thirty five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars and theyre all protected by the government seems to me like theyve gotten around what was laughter intended to be the issue there i guess i dont have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and Ls and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means means im not worried enough i think it could happen yeah uh its kind of thing where maybe well survive and then i then it will happen again because we dont pay attention to those kinds of things i think itll happen again but i think itll be a long time in the future before it does happen again because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future but i think later on theyre gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean youre gonna have to take some risks and as long as theyre backed i think theyre still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it vocalizednoise possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future well perhaps if there are regulatory constraints put back in place it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation uh vocalizednoise

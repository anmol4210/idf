okay um do you want to start do you have a well credit cards um i think think they are wonderful but um i think you have to have a lot of restraint um i have never been in trouble with credit cards but uh my youngest daughter is and a friend of mine is and i think it is terrible that they can uh you know wipe out a max in uh such a short time uh i never pay interest charges i value my money too much to uh line somebody elses pockets with my money and i always um pay it off before um i am charged any interest on my balance so you never let it run up on you that is wonderful that is wonderful im uh i i kind of uh uh im just do very you know just just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off and then i start wanting something and i dont really have enough well dont have enough in savings savings you know like for a big purchase then uh sometimes i i uh lose sight of it you know its it just it is just is easy to use and then uh after a while i i am like you i hate paying those people interest and then i make um umhum i make i i added like uh uh wrote uh an addition to to my car loan through the credit union which i knew was lower interest just to pay them all off and then i swore i would never use them again right you really have to show a lot of restraint but if you look at  if you look at the time frame on that uh you will find that you have about six or seven weeks before you have to make that payment back to the credit card company without being charged any interest the only thing is you have to make sure that you dont charge more than you know you are going to be able to pay thats correct yeah you at a given time and your budget has to be so that you can uh you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that yeah and the problem the problem is especially with young people is they they want things now they dont want to have to wait for them and credit cards are the way to do that thats right and then then theyre in trouble well thats what the you know thats what thats what it is geared for advertisement you know is uh to wet you appetite and give you that oh ive got to have that i cant live without that and thats the image that the younger generation has you know i have a i have a friend who uh well she is old enough to know better but uh she she did it and she got really in bad shape she ended up going into bankruptcy and Palley Royal is her downfall and there is no limit on those things on that they just let you come and spend and you know run it up run it up so i dont know who was that that could Palley Palley Royal is that a department store oh okay thats probably i i do not know if i dont know if it is local no it is not in uh in Dallas huhuh no we we have Dillards and uh Sanger Harris and Macys and no Palley Royal Neiman Marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem laughtereither i know i know a lot of people who uh some gals some ladies at work who dont have any problems with money or anything but they they really love Palley Royal so you know they it is just hard you know you got stay laughteraway or else you might end up you just cant help yourself and buy selfcontrol yeah selfcontrol though is the key selfcontrol is the key my daughter has my daughter is twenty and she got a Sears credit card when she was about eighteen umhum umhum and uh Christmas before last she and her boyfriend her boyfriend had gotten one too i believe and they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to everyone in their family i mean they spent lots of money on they gave each other these beautiful things they gave stuff to all of us and we were going oh dear i cant believe you all did this you should not have done this and they got angry and said we wanted to do it umhum umhum okay now she is still paying on that Sears charge she has now you know shes learned and she she is uh definitely paying it off paying paying on it and not running it back up but you cant tell them well experience is the best teacher and sometimes you know uh a lot of us have have to learn by experience and and uh if you can learn by someones elses past mistakes then you are very wise thats right if you can heed to advice given the only good thing one good thing about credit cards though uh especially in business if you uh you have to you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company thats true yes i am yeah umhum and then uh in fact i know of a man who is in uh he is in a he he he he well he he is in an oil pipe pipe line selling kind of a thing and he has to he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission you know later on but if he did not have credit cards he could not exist because a lot of those you know because he knows six weeks down the road he is probably you know he is going to get the money to pay for it but he really does so sometimes i think oh credit cards are you know really a blessing uh but you have to be wise when you use them thats true and uh i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and you know theyre just hurting theirselves and when you uh have a bankruptcy uh it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record oh yeah and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people wont touch you and youve got to live that down umhum that is true thats really true so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but dont abuse it right uh you know like emergencies or something that you do not have the ready cash that you do not have cash and you have to oh absolutely sure your car breaks down or you have to you have to have something its a real its you know you do not have the money in savings so it really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it but but like you say use it wisely thats right only in you know when you really have to or knowing that you are going to pay it off every every month so that is that is something about American Express if you only use American laughterExpress you do not have a choice well there is a lot of people that uh know exactly what they are doing and they will run into thousands and thousands of dollars into debt and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that theyve bought and put it like in hiding youre kidding no ive heard uh uh there was a radio program in Dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact its nationwide and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that uh program about these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things and then they went bankrupt and they were knowing they were going to go into bankruptcy and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just umhum so they it was planned and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed and i dont know who um determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely what they are were indebted for oh no right so it it they use it as a scam instead of uh to me they were criminals and they used that that in a in a really bad situation and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are working on that to cover you know cover all the loopholes that might exist but ive never been in that situation and hope i never have to be yeah me too really well i guess we covered it do you have any do you have anything else you want to add no i cant think of anything i am sure that we havent covered everything because that is uh that is a great big uh a ball well if you have got any other thoughts uh credit throw them out i cant think of anything right now laughter well listen thank you for calling and you have a good day well thank you Catherine bye

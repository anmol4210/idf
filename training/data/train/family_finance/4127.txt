okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway well i i do take care of pretty much laughterall of the stuff for for my wife and for me and um i embarrassed to say its pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year umhum do you use a computer no i work with them all day yeah im in computer science yet i i do everything on paper laughter uh i dont even use a calculator for the stuff im doing because its all pretty round numbers yeah mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when um he was a Marine he went to Saudi Arabia and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance you know so they come in i pay them and thats it laughteryou laughterknow thats about the extent of it you know yeah i i dont really have this major budget or anything i just really im real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know what little we have laughter so thats what i do yeah its a pretty its almost i cant imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets it seems like if youre getting to that level youre youre not in real good control you know i mean i i ive never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know you buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done you know so actually im i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way its a record of everything and i dont have to worry about keeping laughterrecords of anything else because they come in at the end of the month i dont have too many weaknesses i dont have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them you know its so much easy easier you know if somethings on sale if youre a woman and youre a sale person its like oh well thats on sale lets go grab it you know laughter so um and if you dont have the money then use the credit card so i got rid of them credit cards yeah i guess if thats you know if thats a weakness thats a good thing to do yeah that was my weakness it wasnt bad i mean i didnt have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just learned that that wasnt for me you know but i self employed you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or no its not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what ive made and um you know what its gonna have to go for that month and you know its not that not that hard not at all well thats good to know i always do my own income tax you know do you i dont understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it it seems like its absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it read all you got to do is read a book i mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to yeah just the form yeah yeah and a lot of them its dumb laughteryou laughterknow i guess if you had some really complicated stuff but i dont so i dont mess with it but i dont use a calculator either laughteryou laughterknow i dont i dont have that much that many you know things to add up so i dont trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure that that i i keep on top of the numbers and understand whats going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they werent paying attention oh yeah and we have a i i bank at NCNB here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in like once every other week or so and i will um check off what checks have cleared and do you do that yeah we have the same thing you do too and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have you know i do that real often i do that so

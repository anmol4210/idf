 okay lets see i think uh i guess since i call im supposed to start i think thats the way everybody has done it so far but anyway i i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money um were probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i dont think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a a couple of weeks because theyve been messing it up for many years now so yeah well i have to agree that laughter and and youre right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think theyre mismanaged and i think that sometimes its too easy of a i dont know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say ill tax them if you cant get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending um i dont know what yall are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know were paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation right i think its seven here or seven point something yeah ours is seven point seven five laughteralmost eight and it drives me crazy im thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about  laughter yeah we dont want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they dont do anything about it umhum  right do where are you at what state  im in Lubbock Texas yeah oh really yeah theres were still we still one of few that dont have the uh state tax taxes thats true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay yeah thats true know you dont sound like youre from Dallas where do you come do you come from originally Texas or yeah yeah i do ive lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh its i dont know rural an urban area i guess whatever i dont know what im oh okay you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there no no ive just lived here but i dont know i i do i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i cant think of this the scripture Render unto Caesars what is Caesars so thats right you know even uh i think even in the the story where uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fishs mouth or in the fishs inside the fish and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the vocalizednoise would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself and so thats what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course thats when he said well you know you render unto Caesars what is Caesars you render unto God what is Gods and uh and you know of course there i dont think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something laughter right get in yeah but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i dont want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that theyre necessary you know so i really do oh sure umhum right where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or yeah are no not really i i weve i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year um i have been married for just a few years so ive had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular laughterright all the deductions and all that schedule A well yeah and you know did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder laughter yeah it really did i i saw that too i didnt notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and laughter other things right right thats were looking at buying a house and thats one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and its the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year youve paid all interest and no principles so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back yeah yeah you know theres a a thing i just ive been trying to learn as much as i can about it if if you pay i i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months thats right so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month youll come out paying a uh one month extra every year and itll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note thats right thats right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and thats exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said its going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that oh yeah right yeah uh just because uh exactly what you said youre making one more months payment every year right and thats going on the principle it doesnt pay any interest or usually usually it doesnt anyway yeah so thats thats a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner right thats what were looking at fifteen or maybe twenty were not going to go longer than twenty but were taking our time were going uh try to make our decision by July well thats good though so and we just started like two or three weeks ago and were not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most well thats good though is it kind of a buyers market down there youll be uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so thats well thats good thats laughterpretty excellent i dont know we couldnt think of a better time to buy than now thats good but anyway well um i cant think of a whole lot more to say well i cant either i appreciate the call though yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife vocalizednoise uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married i enjoyed

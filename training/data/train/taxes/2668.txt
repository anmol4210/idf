are you are you a TIer Carla yeah i am oh and you work in the Sherman plant uh whereabouts uh in the front end the wafer fab oh okay good deal oh im in Dallas im in uh in SC group QRA i im kind of a worldwide quality manager based here in Dallas uh mostly the offshore assembly sites where do you work oh great oh wow except im fixing not to be a TIer after a week from today you going to Motorola no im going to Onum uh its a subcontractor house they uh they builds in fact they build product for TI but its been thirty two years so i mean ive ive served ive done my time oh yeah okay you ready to talk about taxes okay oh yeah were you happy with your return this year laughter were you happy with your tax return this year what did you say no laughter no  was it negative okay i guess were on the air now uh well what do you uh what do you think uh uh vocalizednoise what whats your biggest gripe do you think is it the proposed state income tax or the or the gigantic federal income tax we seem to be paying every year or what i think my biggest gripe is the gigantic federal income tax i came from a state that paid uh state taxes three years ago and that seemed to be relatively small compared to like the uh the tax you pay on sales sale items umhum umhum and um i dont know i think uh my biggest gripe is with federal what what state are you from Carla Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax yeah though its a percentage you divide that well you uh how much you paid or something by your federal oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing okay because theres a lot of tax breaks for like you know a lot of things if youre involved in the state like uh giving to colleges and things like that that theyll break you for oh i see okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it um not even sure because i was a student so i didnt pay that much oh okay okay but uh and because as as you know where uh theres theres uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas right and what percent would that be uh i have no idea i i i uh im im originally from Massachusetts but they didnt have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is but you know getting back to the vocalizednoise getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff uh i dont believe it its worse laughter i know well you cant deduct for credit card interest that type of thing oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and uh yeah the only thing thats left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically yeah laughter right right and would then and and thats significant and every once in a while they make noises like theyre going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did oh yeah and and uh one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in in Malaysia for TI and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because ill ill have a lot of equity in my house then when my children are old enough to go to college ill get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so ill be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part oh wow guess what what happened that thats not legal in Texas its the only state in the country that its not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas oh my gosh and and so i i got this i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that ive got almost paid off and have all kinds of equity in it and dont have laughter and you know laughterstruggling to keep ive got two children in college and im going to have three by September laughter oh man but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because ive heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year oh yeah and and im not exactly sure what what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i dont know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes and now were paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with fifty cents its incredible and it is it is absolutely incredible and and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible uh is you know do you have children in school no i dont i just got married i dont have any children oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Texas how long you been in Texas three years oh okay well youll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state thats got a very decent public school system and youll find out that in Texas weve got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise laughtertaxes spend more laughtermoney vocalizednoise i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldnt have so much money going to so many different schools yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the weve got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is theyve got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas yeah ive heard that uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything and and and theyve got uh i dont know what the ratio is but theyve got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching and it is sort of like we do at TI sounds like TI is was getting ready laughterto laughter yeah yeah we get we get fat in laughterthose laughterareas and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got yeah and then all your money goes to overhead uh and and get them in the classroom plus uh i dont know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that arent going allow first first of all theyre not college prep courses and i dont think theyre going vocalizednoise help a person make a living theyre just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate and laughter and and all that and uh so im im not im not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isnt it right in Dallas it uh might be a little less here in Sherman yeah i i think right here in Dallas were paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts ive been here thirty two years but they used to call it Taxachusetts and uh i was there on business this last weekend oh really and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent oh wow i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesnt cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents oh really for it laughterand and i notice theirs doesnt cut in much below fifty cents i think so so the little items you pay what the price tag says now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax i dont know i i dont i bet theyre not i ill absolutely bet theyre not it its interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because ive only heard of it in bits and pieces but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes oh man laughter laughterthey laughterwere laughtergoing laughterto they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i i hadnt uh uh i havent heard that i havent heard that much about it uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana Indiana think it was like five and a half percent uhhuh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana vocalizednoise Indiana University yeah Purdue vocalizednoise no Purdue oh Purdue okay you were you were a Boilermaker huh yeah yeah you follow the girls uh basketball team boy we were were were were tremendous uh girls basketball fans here and we saw them we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin last year oh yeah oh great and we were Lady Longhorn fans naturally but we did see Purdue so were aware uh that theyve that theyve got a very good program there vocalizednoise yeah they well its just been the last three or four years actually they had poor seasons before that but yeah and i think they went further this year uh i i think they got into the second or third round of the of the playoff this year yeah yeah they yeah theyve been exciting to watch yeah and uh thats an vocalizednoise what did you get get your degree in okay supervision supervision thats an interesting degree uh what what sort of things does it entail lot of theory um its pretty its pretty broad uh took some engineering courses some math a lot of uh a lot of theory lot of practical like personal um problems and personnel problems and that type of thing vocalizednoise are you are you actively in supervision now have have you taken some of the TI supervisory skill courses yeah the The Boss Course yeah the Boss Course yeah that was a really good course yeah and and i was i was going to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of vocalizednoise

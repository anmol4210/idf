 do you feel youre paying too much in tax oh i always feel im paying too much for everything laughter thats part of my problem i wonder if we wouldnt be better off um you know with a little more free enterprise than having the government do some much for us thats what my i dont know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price i think youre right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a sort sort of a habit of investing in things that dont pay much return and into getting into projects that uh there is no yield on the investment so its all money down the rat hole yeah it doesnt it doesnt seem like we really get our uh i dont know i i dont think we get the best for the buck if thats if thats a good way to put it but um  uh do you now do you live close to uh uh you know to a government installation of any kind or no im uh sort of in Fairfax County working for uh one of the uh free loaders on the government uh government contract uh group uh oh okay so you know it from the contract side so you know somebody once accused uh accused us of uh uh being a welfare program for engineers laughter laughter yeah my father worked uh for the government uh here in Utah at the Hill Air Force Base where i mean you know that was the occupation that he had all the time i was growing up and and we got a good living out of it but i know just from talking with him there were it was like you said there are a lot of things that go on that just just make you wonder that they dont really even get the best out of the people that are working for them so it makes me wonder where were where were going with that well i think my father went through his life saying that he just keeps paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes and he never laughtergot laughteranything laughterout laughterof laughterthe laughtergovernment laughterfor laughterit well they uh uh yeah they they they provide a lot of services that we dont you you know that we dont really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system well the welfare is a good example that uh you know if if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that that get people involved directly uh then the money gets right straight to the people and theres a lot of volunteer work and and supporting that type of operation but you let the government handle it and next thing you know youre spending four out of five dollars just to administer it yeah i and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people i think i think thats a really good point laughter because i i i think you know welfare is one of the one of the big problems and it its interesting that in uh in a way its interesting to me that that like in the foreign in Russia and those kind areas where theyre having their struggles right now you know theyre gonna have to have a welfare system in order for in order to improve their life over there and i i hope they dont pattern theirs after our laughter yeah well im afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what theyre gonna charge you next year but uh since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled and im just afraid that by the time im ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i wont be able to afford the taxes on it laughteryour monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i uh sold it the the tax payment was a bigger part of the uh yeah that is the of the mortgage payment  yeah hm that that is scary because that really makes you wonder what theyre doing with that i and i figure it just says that uh when im ready to retire im gonna have to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place uh and theres no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay youre assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh you know theres no recourse and what what do you think you get out of your taxes your property taxes well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services uh and i i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system im a little concerned that theres too much paper work there for them

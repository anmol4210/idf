so uh do you keep a monthly budget or anything like that oh yeah i im one of those people who keep a record of everything laughter so you you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card and all the A T M transactions and everything and ive got a file for each of them and how do you categorize these things thats what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh i i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for okay um so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid unless i get paid on time like like for instance if a bill is due on March fourth ill just ill put it in the folder with March and that way when i get paid in March i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uhhuh go ahead right and that and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not okay and uh what happens then when you dont when i dont what have extra money laughter laughter then i dont do anything laughter ive got two little boys oh okay oh uhhuh so im at home most of the time anyways but like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my kids for the day and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but its something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids because youre always got to have money when you have laughterkids oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey im willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on well i have a i have a running budget for every month clothing or and on that budget i type up a budget for every month in the year and it has the bills that i know i have every month electric phone food the kids pediatrician uhhuh uhhuh uh my Visa bill you you know all the bills i know i have every month are on that budget and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if theres not then i know that money the rest of the money is mine so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on oh yes groceries that you expect to spend for each month okay and things like um now some some expenses come up you know twice a year or once a year like insurance right or well that comes up every six months for me or like tags come up once a year and youve got to figure that in too so you have an entry for each month for those things right whenever my tags come up uh there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so im expecting it and and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck uh is in that month because after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month i could pay with that hundred and fifty dollars and then whats vocalizednoise left i can do what what i want with uhhuh so now what about the uh long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff well ive got an annuity fund set up because i dont know uh just the way i was raised i look toward the future not only for my kids but for myself and ive got an annuity for me and every two months i buy my boys each a savings bond every since they have been born ive been doing that that sounds great um so now what exactly in an annuity ive always found those a little confusing an annuity is an account its like a uh its its a type of savings account okay but you dont touch it you just deposit money into it but you dont touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement okay now do you pay taxes on the interest not right now okay only when you draw it out and like if elderly people they have a choice of having an IRA account and they get special discounts on like the um whats the word im trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an IRA they get special rates on it and stuff  you mean from the you mean from taxes or from from the federal government you mean uhhuh right for the elderly people and stuff that have IRAs set up and they get special discounts on that but an an annuity is its a savings account that you dont withdraw anything out of you just keep depositing money into it okay now i guess the question is is it better than an

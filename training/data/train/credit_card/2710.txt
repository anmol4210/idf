i started when i was in college you know they always offer credit cards for college students so i went ahead and and accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early so i pack i pack around a lot of them but i only use a few of them you have a lot of discipline they make it really easy for people to uh to get credit cards especially college students i have uh two daughters who who both are in college or in fact one has finished now but they both have laughter a lot of credit cards and they give you such high credit limits its its easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap uh right and then they they give you uh uh the credit limit and then youre always seemingly seemingly up to that limit now i have quite a few credit cards that im always almost up to the limit on most of them and thats thats how a lot of people get into trouble yeah ive got ive got two that i you know that usually ill have a a balance on and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and and pay it off every month that way i feel like im getting you know a thirty day loan but i dont have to worry about you know running them up too high except at Christmas then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty laughtergood yeah well you have a lot of discipline i uh im trying my best right now to pay off some of mine i ive paid off about four credit cards this year and uh but still i have some that are laughter are up to the limit and especially the Visa card that you can go and get cash on laughter it seems like every time im short of cash i just go get get it from Visa now thats one thats ive never used my Visa for cash before can you use it like at a bank machine or it well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say i want a cash advance or if theyve sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh Impact machines or whatever you you can do that oh okay because i have one that i dont have a pin number for you know sometimes you have to ask them for that and then i have one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically now we got thats thats funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadnt even applied for then a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers and then we got a a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars and we we cut them up and sent them back because we we hadnt even applied for them and we didnt want them but they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us oh wow laughter so i thought man i dont know if i trust this or not laughter laughter well they they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card its like lets see if we can get her to run up her bills laughter but its hard i mean its its tempting when you see something to say well ill just charge it and sometimes ill do that but usually i i will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that that usually have an outstanding balance all the time ill ill pay more than the minimum payment just i feel i feel like even that little bit helps right well you know the way the economys going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible thats thats why ive ive really started to try to to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might you know get laid off or something especially me i work for Texas Instruments and theyve had had a lot of of uh you know layoffs lately i know it well i work for TI too you do and i think theyre getting ready to to probably sell us out our division where are you in Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City uhhuh i know theyre selling out somebody in Colorado Springs yeah they just they just announced that didnt they so i mean its its kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards it it certainly is ive um i have worked on a part part time job um where i was a collector for um uh uh a jewelry company laughter people um that they just had this jewelry account it was Zales Jewelry in fact and uh a whole bunch of people i mean they have about a laughterthousand collectors i guess and uh theres just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just cant pay for it something something happens you know you hear so many stories listening to them like uh you know they lost their job or uh they theyve signed for a friend you know they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend laughter wouldnt pay them and now theyre stuck with the bill and its ruining their credit and didnt pay them vocalizednoise you really have to watch it this you know because yeah because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know automatically most most of them do thats scary i didnt realize that yeah and if you if youre uh its bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then youre youre not past due until the fifteenth of the next month but oh okay you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth youre not one day late youre thirty laughterdays late they dont they dont recognize any time difference do they right laughter and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of ooh thats scary thats something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like umhum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs about ten dollars might be worth it for peace of mind oh yeah it is it is you might even find somebodys been reporting on you and you laughterdidnt even know it you know you i mean you might think youre paying something on time or and you by that day and youre thirty vocalizednoise thirty days is not real bad though anyway if youve got a charge off on your credit report report or something like that thats when it really gets bad or something you havent paid in sixty days or ninety days you know things like that i think that Discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you dont go crazy trying to get cash back and since they dont have the yearly fee do they charge a lot of interest on that card i dont i dont know ive never i havent gotten one just because its i i felt like with Visa and MasterCard and American Express you didnt need another one i would think it wouldnt be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges so that that wouldnt be too bad well always watch out for somebody anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia or theres a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty one and twenty two percent interest i know i had a charge with uh Spiegel laughter and i hadnt read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance off you know and i looked at the credit card agreement one day and it was like twenty three percent interest holy cow and thats the one bill that i hurry up hurried and paid up and and ive always watched it since then you really have to watch those interest rates definitely thats awful i mean theres no point in giving them any more money than we have to laughterso thats true laughter so anyway they cant bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in Texas but there there are a couple of states that can well thats great and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta laughter Atlanta Georgia laughter ill try to remember that one laughter see i was trying to think if there was anything else so i guess the worst problem i ever had with with a credit card though was um i got a an item on my bill that i had never purchased i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they werent supposed to process it until they delivered it and i changed my mind but then they went ahead and charged it on my account and it took me about eighteen months to get that all of that mess off of my account so thats thats probably the worst thing ive ever had happen with a credit card i wonder if they

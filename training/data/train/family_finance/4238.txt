 so uh how do you go about doing household finances laughter pretty loosely laughter i dont have a ive never have a laughter laughteryeah me too laughter had a tremendously organized budget ive you know kind of know how much the monthly bills are by you know looking at the previous month and i know about what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight uh organized budget that you stay within ive ive just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes boy me too its uh fly by the seat of my pants uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage then she dropped out of the work force and uh we we have two children both under four so uh oh wow i ive taken total responsibility but i guess i havent taken vocalizednoise youve got two now under four yeah yeah wow laughter theyll laughterbe yeah theyll be uh four and two in April respectively ive got a senior in high school whos just just getting out in May were probably the same age laughter yeah im forty four forty two yeah most most of my friends have uh children uh you who are having children it seems like but uh we vocalizednoise we actually ran one checkbook with i mean one account with two checkbooks off the same account for a long for a long time but thats real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesnt or or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other one about laughterit laughteror laughtersomething you know so we finally switched to the two method too it seemed to work better yeah i think when uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility uh  it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff oh sure now its my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesnt im not being critical but my wife kind of has the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check you know and its unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but its almost that attitude you still got checks you still got money right laughter yeah right yeah laughterthats laughteryeah thats kind of how it comes out well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run mine and uh not really mix the two and uh the you know bills that are if were both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then one or of the other of us writes the other one a check for their portion and then one person mails it all you know to the to the bank or whoever if its something were doing that way if its uh if its something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do yeah well how how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh in our in our case its more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months were really going to watch it and well try try to control the big things uh its kind of the way it is its its never been uh like my brother is organized to the nth degree he and i are exactly opposite hes two years younger than i am and he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and hes a real tight wad with uh the money and ive always been a little looser well thats how we both are and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh during a a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then thats kind of a joint yeah we we thing too so yeah we went through a period uh well we went through six years of infertility and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that oh yeah those are  and my wife was working at the time so it it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasnt too difficult with the two incomes and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldnt have children so we sort of indulged and we uh leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it thatll do it everytime you immediately get pregnant if you do that laughter well thats what exactly what happened yeah we

 well i dont know if theres gonna be a solutions to the US budget well i know its in pretty disastrous shape for sure its only getting worse exponentially it seems um yes exactly theres uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybodys pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition that oh which state is that uh state of Minnesota so theres the potential that perhaps you know the US budget might wanna take a look at its uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well lets freeze wages i mean everybodys doing it so it isnt like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shirtshort thats got to be very short term  right and and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where theyre spending the money and not so much as saying  well were spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars  right and it was just laughteri laughtermean you can go to Kmart and buy them for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats so yeah definitely i think that theres probably a lot of so it gives you an idea that waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place sure sure so i mean there was um people at Stanford who were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to um for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was and i think that that may be more widespread than we think sure than well than wed like to think but  but then you know its something thats hard to enforce too im sure umhum it sure is the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know theyre getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in laughtercongress the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers money for that and its a real big crunch uh of course when they get caught then theyre you know theyre guilty of course but uh during that time im sure theres hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them well thats right the i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but im not sure that thats really that much of the problem i mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much you know at a million dollars a pop for Patriot missiles exactly and i i dont think uh its ended up being i mean it gave people jobs but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after theyre done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use i mean it was kind of like okay well do this during this point and time but after that thats you know um they didnt wanna do it anymore so a lot of things that theyre saying that theyre no longer gonna be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so i dont know  okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening okay all right you too byebye uhhuh thanks bye now

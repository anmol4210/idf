okay uh lets see what do you use or how do you control your money well right now we dont have a whole lot of money laughter so theres not much to control laughter um basically im usually the one that uh handles the money um vocalizednoise uh my husbands been unemployed for a little more than a year so weve kind of uh its been extremely tight but weve managed somehow um we pay the necessities and uh from there if theres anything left laughter try and save some of it but uh how you want to go ahead and say what you do yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right and uh you know your rent and whatever else and uh and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever you know and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for for miscellaneous things but one thing that weve used and its its its kind of good because it gives it gives you uh kind of a savings plan sort of and uh what it is we have a ledger you know just a a book and in it in it we have different accounts uh that lets say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something thats what would go into savings for instance uh we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories so for instance uh lets say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair uh maintenance or whatever another so youve already got it there when youve got the right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars saved for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever however you know vocalizednoise up to a hundred twenty dollars thats a good idea yeah yeah and thats how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car vocalizednoise you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that and and it seems to work  you dont just go overboard spending too much of the savings on one particular thing right right thats a good idea when we have some money well do that laughter and so it you know it seems to it it seems to work pretty good you know the the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every every month of stuff but that seems to work pretty good and uh see other things we do is just uh just try to uh just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know and uh we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that but how about you guys  well some thats there therere several things i do to save money um one is to use garage sales and we do a lot get a lot of things used and the things that we do have i try and recycle a lot you know before ill get rid of something ill look at it and think what else can i do with this and uh how else can i use this right uhhuh to solve some other problem somewhere else you know and uh that has helped a lot um and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need so that ive got it ahead of time and i dont have to go out and buy it something not on sale because ive already gotten it on sale then when the sale comes around again go ahead and stock up again well thats a good idea yeah have you gone to any of those places that uh you know like uh uh uh i guess the different names for them are like the Price Club or Sams or Sams um we have a Sams not too far away but i havent uh used it yet things like that uh theyre going to theyre building a new one thats going to be even closer and im ill probably use it when its over here even a little closer yeah ive been in a couple and it seems like you can get pretty good uh you know stretch your money there because you get the the big things you know yeah you have to buy quantity right right but um thats how you save money you know and thats and uh one of my i recently got a masters in computer systems science or computer systems and one of the things i really learned a lot was uh theres a number of programs for the computers for if you happen to have a personal computer or whatever that a lot of programs thatll help you you know budget your money and uh and uh its kind of really neat because it does a lot of things for you as far as vocalizednoise give you all your graphs and your charts and stuff and show you where youre spending money so if youre really honest about inputting everything that you spend your money on youd be you youre really surprised at like boy you know i spend a whole lot of money on like candy or something you know laughter and  yeah yeah well i think theres an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we really dont need and i think since being unemployed we vocalizednoise look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want right right and uh you have to decide how much you want and and i think uh uh ive noticed that however much money you have you can spend that much or more you know people people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards thats one thing were trying try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs right that can get you in trouble pretty quick yeah yeah if you vocalizednoise and i really like paying cash instead of checks even um we got changed to an economy account at the credit union so it costs less to use less checks  and um those are just little things you can do well that sounds that sounds pretty good well you have anything else to say or any other plans that you use uh i like what you say about the recycling thing looking at something before you get rid of it thats a good thats a good thing  yeah i uh having a garage sale yourself helps we just had one this last week laughterend oh did you well we did we did something like that too we recently moved here from California and uh we had a there was like a bargain fair you know where everybody brings stuff to sell oh yeah and uh and there really we made a lot of money i was surprised a lot of baby clothes we sold and stuff that we dont need any more and stuff but uh but uh i was surprised yeah thats a good way to make some money yeah when you cant use it any more yeah thats right thats uh i think uh learning how to do things yourself a lot helps too like i cut everybodys hair myself oh thats good and if you can uh just watch how they do it at the uh shop or

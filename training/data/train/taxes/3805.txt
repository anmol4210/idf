um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our moneys worth hey listen if i had my way i wouldnt pay my taxes not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night no i did not i was well they did a  thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we dont need and uh well how does this grab you how does this grab you its staggering um this i i mean im im a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was uh about the NEA and thats the National Endowment for Arts and they fund they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money well there are a lot of things that people i think generally and then it just frosts me terribly well i think its interesting to look at um where the money vocalizednoise goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i dont think generally i think whats interesting is that  we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with i believe thats true yes and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us thats correct i mean and i think its gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh heavy involvement from the public yeah right thats your i think thats the only thing thats gonna change it and yeah heavy involvement from the public our our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part um ive ive said for years that theres full employment for the politically active and in our society uh theres very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyers uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting  which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve thats not a formula for a better society no it is not its lopsided very much so and the government really plays a role in this uhhuh thats right they pull the strings i mean vocalizednoise well well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful interest right the yeah laughter you know and its really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others dont and they think its unfair and when they recognize its their tax money theyre gonna do more about it i think ill tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about whats going on in this country they expect  opening it for one hour that theyll get three hundred thousand telephone calls im sure they will and ive thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think thats coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then i think you know its gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our moneys worth and as you said its how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or i like this or i dont like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i dont think is art yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it  well thats the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it  is telling us more you know about the problems so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out weve wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country oh absolutely over a very long period of time right absolutely um and uh we only see the tip of the iceberg its only you know theres so much of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture laughter well you may be right vocalizednoise what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say its its a

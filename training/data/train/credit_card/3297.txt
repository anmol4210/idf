 credit cards is one of my laughter wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or i got rid of mine about uh oh its been about four years ago now and uh went on a strictly cash basis uh sometimes its inconvenient but it is so much better for me it is because i i am the type that will always find an laughteremergency laughteroh me laughtertoo but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy and im not paying the high interest rates thats what kills you on those credit cards because its so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well ill just pay off the whole balance and then i wont owe any and then something comes up you know and well ill just pay the minimum well you just do that forever oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards youre not getting anywhere because youre paying your interest every month and thats all youre doing no youre paying interest and with our Visa thats really high interest were in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards so that somehow we can get ahead on that you know ive ive thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days yes pay the balance at the end of the month umhum right and just for ID purposes but its become such a way of life oh it has like i say it was so convenient and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card they laughteri laughterknow like you paid that one off now heres laughteranother when really youre paying a loan for the other one uh right so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and ive ive been able to buy as much or more by just going cash and like i say it was tough because its a really its a habit it is because you think oh ill get this and just pay it off later or you know youll think okay ive got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something you think well ill just put this one thing on it well you dont do that once you start you know youre going to have a bill coming in anyway might as well just yeah like you said theres a lot of things that i could probably do without that i dont do without because i have the credit card you know and uh and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into uhhuh yeah uh my husband and i just moved from South Dakota to um Plano Texas and uh that was the thing that helped helped us get down here and thats what were trying to get down on that because the credit card helped us move because we had just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving expenses but um now were in the process of trying to get that down too but it it did help in that kind of a situation but um well you know there are times when you know it is but i ive been laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards oh really youre youre stuck i would well you know it it really helped that i didnt have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them i would have lived on them yeah because you didnt have any other income and uh this way you know i i made do and uh when i was you know employed then i didnt have all that that i had to go back and say well ive got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now right and that thats good thats a good feeling not to know it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase and pay cash and pay cash it was a real good feeling i bet

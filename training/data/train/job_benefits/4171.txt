so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm well its about three hundred and fifty people i guess thats not large compared to some but its big enough  and they have a they dont have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and i wish they did you know they have a K but i put all the money into it they dont add anything what about you uh i work for a fairly large company its got eight thousand people and uh we do have health insurance and we dont have OK K plan stuff like that but we do have like retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then  the rest is whatever you want to put in if you want to put more than that or something like that oh thats a pretty good deal  thats not bad now how long does it take for your contribution to vest God i dont know laughter its probably a long time laughter im sure its not till like twenty five years thirty years yeah the place i work at is health insurance is kind of expensive its like you know hundred bucks a a month or something for a family huh well i guess what we have is like a flex what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh  guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use it or lose it and that doesnt get taxed or you can just have that money you know put in your paycheck yeah we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh theyll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses i can send in a uh can send in a request for payment and theyll uh and theyll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld thats pretty good you know its uh it saves a third off on taxes or something yeah well it depends on which company you work for i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan D laughter deductibles are really high its like fifteen hundred dollars but if you go for the other ones youre paying too much money for them because its unlikely if youre fairly relatively uh healthy then its really unlikely that youre gonna use that much amount of money you know so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss whatever whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual laughter  yeah i guess uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan and uh one of my kids was in a car accident and and i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is  really you mean not even your douryour your car insurance  well it it vocalizednoise got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here and and i had a high deductible on the  on the uh on the car car insurance and then vocalizednoise you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and  oh thats too bad laughter blew it laughter oh well yeah uh well i dont know i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh  time off would be nice i only get two weeks yeah yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every every year they give you an extra day until youve got four weeks oh thats nice we dont get them till till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week thats a long time yeah its uh yeah especially in the kind of engineering job im in you know companies dont stay afloat that long laughter and and they  uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used it used to be much more stable its a lot less stable than it used to be they used to have job security and crap but now they dont so you work for Bell or something like that yeah its the Bell Corps which is uh right right yeah so i dont know its its uh no longer laughter so thats what i think its still based on the old model of  and and now they dont uh a lifelong job security telephone pioneers of America all that stuff huh yeah but the the no no longer laughter i dont think so uh hearing a lot theres always theyre always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security oh does is it i mean does it they must have pretty good severance though huh ah i dont know we dont we havent been doing layoffs weve been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management and uh i dont know what they do for those people i mean the the the management they get rid of some of it yeah theres too many managers too many chiefs and not enough Indians but oh they they put

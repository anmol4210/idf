well budgeting is a sore subject in this laughterfamily yeah me too i know exactly what laughteryou laughtermean laughter weve actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um vocalizednoise i think its good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we we never seem to be able to stick with it no its really hard to do that i mean its laughter i dont know i guess um we do kind of have a budget um but its kind of funny what we what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make uh do you not understand what im saying we we pay a percentage um which is kind of strange laughter a lot of people dont do laughterthat but hey we find that it works you know now im sorry what is what is this again laughter well okay um laughter like i pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the bills and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck do you understand laughter okay i guess i didnt really explain that too laughterwell oh okay oh i see oh sure yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense laughter yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um we weve got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately theres a big category called miscellaneous oh laughter that one gets used up quick is that it laughter and uh miscellaneous thats the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we figure its going to be its never what it was last month and uh and uh you know its its the one thats always the killer thats laughter um but i uh you know its uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um so so oh wow thats really that is pretty detailed so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category were paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our moneys going we dont have any control over it but we have a real good sense of where its going laughter well but you know thats good too because ive been in the situation in the past where i didnt know where my money was going and that thats hard to you know you cant keep up with it and it really gets you in trouble laughter you know and were were at a point where were trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like my wifes going back to school and im going to school and were our kid weve got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things oh yeah and uh i think i think wed be totally bankrupt if we didnt do something um and and what weve proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month is that were spending more than than we make laughter so its its kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah thats easy to do its very easy to do and its vocalizednoise i dont vocalizednoise it do you find it easier to i mean do with a budget do you feel like youre you do i mean i know you said you have better control but do you feel like youre really saving anything i mean  well no i i i think um i i i dont think were saving anything i i think what were doing is were were were making it possible to to well and the fact what it is is its making it possible to live beyond our means um vocalizednoise because oh laughter well thats you know what if we didnt track it wed wed totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um so you know we we do know that we can tell when were getting to the point where weve just got to uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says this you know we cant do this right now because the moneys just not there we we were going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it vocalizednoise you know its um we uh you know were not going to get this budget isnt going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but which is easy to do yeah uhhuh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too you know im going back to school my wifes going back to school too our lifestyle right now is meant to position ourselves so financial uh the these financial problems wont be problems uh in the future and uh so weve thats thats the were look we look it as as yeah were living like this now but its a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on right well thats good laughter i know what you mean about the school because thats what im trying to do also and were trying to build it enough so that i can go to school full time because right now im going to school part time were going were going through the exact same thing yeah laughter so you know trying to budget is again you know at at this point were trying to budget enough so we can save more um you know so i can go to school full time you know its its not easy to do but laughter i i dont know that wed ever be able to get to that point but uh but its something to work for laughter oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough itll happen laughterbecause because i can we can see it you know i think its going to be a couple of years before i can do that yeah yeah thats i think were in probably in the same position you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps right yeah yeah um and and and it also makes it possible you i think before we did any kind of budgeting we we we were in we were in a constant state of saying we cant afford anything you know we cant do anything we cant afford anything and now we can at least say well we can fit this in its it doesnt really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldnt before yeah it really makes a world of difference doesnt it it really does i know ive been in like i said the same situation you know where ive ive been in a situation where i didnt budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent laughtermoney and it doesnt work laughter it doesnt it really doesnt uh makes a big difference thats right thats right laughter it it it yeah i we i think that uh part of the uh the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that that there were those years where we lived that way and were still paying for it oh definitely laughter laughteryou laughterknow and so the only way to get out from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting yeah you dont want to especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up and theyre they want to do things like go to college uh you dont want to say well were still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and yeah well thats thats a big thats really important because i do have a college fund set aside for my kids you know and my oldest one is um almost going on nine so you know its not that many years you know laughter before shes going to be going so i hope that you know i can continue the college fund because its thats right thats right i know its important that they go to college when they get out of high laughterschool laughteryeah laughterright well you know i were were were trying to put money away for that too and uh um um you know you just cant count on them being totally brilliant though though they are but you cant count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um its you know no thats true i mean it doesnt always work that way laughter you hope you hope that they can but laughter you know you cant plan laughterright yeah thats right right laughter thats thats the way you have to do it right no laughter right or at least loans laughter that they pay off laughter yeah yeah well no thats thats an important thing to me and thats why it was very important for me because i didnt go to college out of high school it was important for me to budget in uh yeah a um college fund for them because it was just so important i said i dont want them to go through what i went through they have to have a college laughterfund so well you know the the im im also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them because uh when i grew up i had no no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um yes i know exactly laughter i was the same way so we were trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of thats supposed to go to savings for instance very good yeah and uh um yeah and they understand our eh the process our process vocalizednoise uhhuh youre thats thats thats strange because ours all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them oh yeah and all their money has to go in their savings account you know which maybe im being a little bit too harsh laughterbut but if they need something i buy it for them you know i mean if its an absolute need you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if its a need i just get it

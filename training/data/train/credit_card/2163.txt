okay i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute laughter well credit cards boy thats an easy topic isnt it laughter is it yes it is laughter its one we all hold dear and near im sure oh yes yes i guess ive had some good experience and some bad experience with them yeah most of mines been pretty good although im i guess im like a lot of other people now im trying to to pay off my credit cards and ive done pretty good at it well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want laughter you now not need want laughter uhhuh there is a big difference theres a big difference there yeah yeah but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them ive been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas its too easy to to run into the gas station oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least thats for me yeah what you yeah yeah but yeah ive ive talked to some whos really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i havent yet not bad you know i just im just shocked at the end of the month yeah well to see what damage i have did but yeah yeah i try to keep it pretty reasonable well ive been pretty lucky in that respect i dont charge like i say ive i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies so but i havent really had any bad problems with credit cards theres you know they have uh wonderful features theyre there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest its like paying laughtertwice yeah they talk talks with vocalizednoise thats true thats true so but i try to i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest oh uhhuh yeah compared to some of the other ones and you dont have an annual fee there and that helps oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now were just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in yeah thats one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well ill just pay on it this month and laughter pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time takes a long time thats right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax thats you know it sure does of course its been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so but yeah yeah well ive enjoyed talking to you well ive enjoyed talking to you and maybe well get to talk again okay byebye

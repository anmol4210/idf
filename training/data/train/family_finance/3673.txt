 you keep a budget um yes i do okay how how do you work that well usually it works out pretty well does it um i try to project out um right now i project out six months you know i have my fixed monthly bills and i know how much they are right  uhhuh and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to take off the top not unless i have something come up thats unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings well that seems to work out pretty good kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check and then i retain ten percent and if i dont use it then it goes into savings also for savings oh is it is it hard to set it up for the six month period rather than just a month or well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due so in fact so you budget all that in thats why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months ill have insurance it might two or three times a year and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point oh so really when youre doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for the six month period rather than just a month at a time oh umhum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of whats going on in your life because it doesnt give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for oh right and then also i mean thats if you do it monthly thats twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that yeah i do it uh twice a year and um you know i could adjust it every month thats no big deal uhhuh uhhuh but uh i just finished out December and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had January through July made out so you do it January to July and then July to December oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off umhum yeah i take the savings right off the top i pay myself first im the type of individual that uh you know i cant i have to put something back for myself to feel like im doing my job right right its my motivator and how much at what percentage do you save i save about fifteen percent oh thats great out of what out of my savings account not as well as the Japanese do laughter well that thats fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month twice a month uh uh actually every other week so twenty six checks every two weeks during the year oh thats great we so twice a year i pick up an extra check also oh thats right so that helps out gives you a bit there oh how do you all do yours well we we dont really do very laughterwell we have never sat down and made out a formal budget we keep saying you know were going to do this were going to do this we we take our savings right out vocalizednoise right out first and put you know put it away and then we just uh were thats terrible but we just kind of spend what we laughterneed thats right thats right we take the savings out and uh you know put that in and then spend whats left over huh spend what whats left over like you said and i know we if we keep but we just dont know how to get down and get started i guess trying to decide how much goes where and you know theres really no certain formula that you can say well i i wanna say this much and im gonna spend this much for the house and uh im kind of in a situation right now that my our children are grown and theyre gone so uh you know and the house is almost paid for so were in pretty good shape oh thats great now how did you get started when you started doing have you always done a budget or what uh weve done them for about fifteen years about fifteen years oh so quite a while huh did you just sit down and decide this much is this much is gonna go here and the thing we have a hard time with was you know like how much for the groceries and how much for the clothes and how much for one thing we do about the groceries and when and we just got back from the grocery store and weve been doing this for a long time and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery store because when we come home we write it down so in a given month we know that we spent two hundred and fifty dollars or four hundred dollars or whatever it is and if its four hundred dollars we look at it and say well why did we spend four hundred dollars and we spent four hundred dollars this month because or last month because uh we had several Christmas parties December right right so but we know approximately how much our our monthly grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within ten or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record if we just huh so and once you establish your track record so what

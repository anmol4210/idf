i guess so laughter okay ready to talk okay uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that its worked and the times that it hasnt worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit laughter laughterokay laughter tell me how yours work well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh were on the east coast now my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do thats satisfactory and weve been here seven months and hes still hasnt hit up on anything permanently oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast laughter so you see well we actually planned for about one year oh good uh thank God because it never occurred laughter really that was smart laughter it never occurred to us that it would take seven months and uh what we did was just uh decide what how we had been spending our money before and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didnt want to come down oh uhhuh and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would vocalizednoise wow thats great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of oh just our own design uhhuh uhhuh gosh and uh so but weve had budgets that didnt work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing laughterworked we spent too much money until our kids children went to college so so tell me about do you all uh have a budget well weve been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more  fun kinds of laughterthings that uh didnt really um  you know have a real strict budget but budget but uh the the about into our when when when when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just you know dirt poor then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided wed bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a laughterhouse laughteranyway laughterno laughtermatter laughterhow laughtermuch laughterwe laughtersaved and moved to Texas and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i dont know if we laughter we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least weve got a place to live um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um three and a two year old bang bang uhhuh laughter thats that that threw our budget laughterreally laughterout laughterof laughterout laughterof laughterwhack laughtertoo and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and um we just really have uh  uh i dont know weve weve tried different times weve done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went and we really dont spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like theres um times when we just have to get out where well go and like get a babysitter and well go and well blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know well i think thats important for your budget to be realistically for it to work though you have to do something yeah thats the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then its not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they dont know the difference at this age you know whether theyre Jordache new or whether laughtertheyre of course not you know laughtersomething and theyre both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each others clothes so but um thats the hardest part for us is that its really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before yeah yeah and i really believe that if youre going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down laughtersomewhat laughteron laughteryour laughterfriends on your laughterfriends thats true laughter thats true laughter well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and well end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and you know a lot of things like that that really is are hard to plan for and uh well i really do i think you have to budget those things though yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year youre going to have on extra expenses for car and exactly or know so much per month anyway yeah yeah and uh that really should be in your bank but if you dont spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the laughtermonth laughter yeah laughter our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know isnt isnt lets see now i forget which way we do it we dont list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year oh no no no no laughter you dont want the government to spend your money you want to be able so thats not a good laughterway laughterof laughterdoing laughterit thats what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didnt get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money laughter well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many years for many years yeah yeah uh and if and if thats the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it thats what you should do yeah because we dont miss it we really dont when its just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so umhum umhum but were trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision envision the uh expenses for college already you know laughtereighteen laughteryears laughteraway laughteror laughterwhatever well i was just reading an article in uh a North Carolina paper paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done i guess thats fantastic where theres a will where theres a will theres a way right yeah laughter well i have enjoyed talking to you well i enjoyed talking to you too good luck and dont spend any money this laughterweekend laughter oh i know uh well have to stay home and mow the yard laughter laughter oh boy laughter bye

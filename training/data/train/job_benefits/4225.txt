okay well are you still there yeah im here yeah uh we got real good benefits where im at although theyre becoming uh less and less every year so that theyre taking a little bit more away uh especially when it comes to health care benefits do you guys uh have full coverage where youre at yeah well we do um its its funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs in general yeah our benefits uh we we have a choice between an HMOs between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical Blue Cross Blue Shield and um seems like the main idea of insurance companies is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible yeah yeah i i i agree uh you you pay a lot of money into them and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesnt meet their uh you know their their minimum amounts or something like that theyve always got these uh these plans set up where they theyve got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain operation or something but when you go to that doctor its always like ten or fifteen dollars more than what theyll pay for and uh thats one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh the the primary or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the doctors around here charge seventy five so it doesnt really keep up with what they actually have so its kind of a they vocalizednoise they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh yeah absolutely other thing about Pratts benefits uh when i first came here five years ago they really had like the best i thought that id ever had and since then you know theyve for the staggering skyrocketing uh medical costs like youve said uh theyve really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company yeah its expensive uh its very expensive for the company to uh to pay all the benefits out uh if you want to talk for a second about non health benefits uh at my office we have free drinks free beverages and uh thats really popular thats very uh a lot of people like that where we have uh all kinds of uh uh well here we call it pop i guess on the east coast youd call it soda and uh juices and oh you have soda oh coffee and tea and uh uh spring water hot and cold and soups and thats well thats pretty good benefit then yeah its very nice uh often if youre just having trouble thinking and doing your work you can just get up and walk to the kitchen and uh make yourself a cup of tea a fresh cup of tea herbal tea or whatever and well i didnt i guess i never really thought about that as a benefit we we can get up and go to our cafeteria and you know and pay to get something to drink but i guess i guess that is kind of a benefit to just to have a place to go do that yeah oh definitely it gives you a chance yeah we we have a real nice cafeteria we can go to that anytime during the day and its always it is always nice to go down there and get a coffee or a tea or a juice sure absolutely and get your and give your mind a rest yeah that thats thats always good uh do you guys have like a savings plan uh well the company offers a K but they dont contribute at all uh our uh we were really lucky in that respect our for every dollar we put in Pratt Whitneyll match us sixty cents so that is great that that that thats real good and thats thats one reason why i really like that yeah that that that is a very nice benefit one of the things that we have lacking is the number of vacation days we have uh only two weeks vacation a year does it depend on how many years youve been there no its just across the board wow thats really something uh at Pratt its uh if youre there eight years or less its two weeks and as soon as you get your eight year in you get three weeks and then when you get uh fifteen years you get another week so you know a guy whos been out been out there for like twenty five thirty years get about uh you know five weeks vacation paid a year yeah well in the technology industry its such a young industry that there arent very many people that have been in it for a very long time so they dont have the same uh oh okay scale although at other jobs ive had ive ive had three weeks vacation so uh so stripping down to two was uh how are your how how how important is that you know your benefits when you sound like youve uh done some job hopping youve had more than one job then uh three ive had three oh okay with that how many how much time did you spend with each one very short oh okay the first the first job with the first two were a year and a half each and uh and after that i worked for two years at the company im at where i plan to stay for a while okay and and thats up in in Pittsburgh you said thats right thats right but you know in the the computer the computer industry is a little bit more liberal with benefits in general i think than other industries um in terms of uh flex hours and just the you know the whole attitude of the work place ah thats another thats another benefit i forgot to mention we have flex time you also have that thats right thats one of my favorite benefits uh ever since ive been ever since i graduated from school in eighty six every job ive had has always

something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didnt uh get too much built up on it that we didnt know it was out there but we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off which  which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card yeah its its strange that that i guess to draw new customers ive seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine i cant imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have you know eighteen percent some of them even higher and uh uh you know it its some of them are almost uh usurious the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your all your purchases back but they had a uh a users fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee if you use it at a uh a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so laughterthat would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh that were with does charge you if you happen to use outside theirs but thats theres so many of theirs that it doesnt matter i i hardly i never have that i know of yeah its like my uh ATM card  if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and its down in the lobby ive got a these automatic teller machines then its very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars for that transaction which i thought gosh and if you happen vocalizednoise to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least thats thats something huh the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so theres theres several opportunities to use the uh card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and its real convenient just to run up and get cash fact its the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh im with so thats nice to have those around and i only drive ten miles to work so its kind of a uh one of those situations where theyre theyre all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them  do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i i guess i i dont know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasnt too bad it wasnt but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had yeah thats well thats thats not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me and uh you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money laughterbefore it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldnt have been uh quite so expensive i guess thats the way they planned on doing it i cant imagine what i its been several years i cant imagine what i did to uh i do seem to recall oh i i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh gosh i dont know what it i dont think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places places were closed it was after hours as it were and there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open

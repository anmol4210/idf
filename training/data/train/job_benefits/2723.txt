about how many calls have you made on this system uh ive originated only a a few oh okay yeah but ive received quite a few i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck thats right im supposed to make a few calls so i started about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all uh our little gift book goes up to but i dont really know oh yeah ive got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have youve vocalizednoise a few yeah ive been getting mine okay uh medical go ahead im vocalizednoise im medical thats mine uh you pushed the record button were supposed to be discussing the subject yeah i im benefits go ahead you first yeah uh well ill tell you ive been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh its hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either that we get from TI im quite pleased with it course theres a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEOs seat but um oh yeah i think Jerrys doing a pretty good job as it goes the one vocalizednoise its kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although ive used medical a little bit uh that well that one certainly is high i i worry that its weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say id like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better then salary salary salary continuance ive never used that one i hope i never will but thats kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one well vocalizednoise ah yes thats like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there well uh like i say i worked for several different companies and theres nothing to compare with uh TI here now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff uh i wasnt with GSI but i was connected with uh uh oil uh exploration with TI or somebody else no with TI but i say i wasnt connected with GSI oh right yeah and i got caught up in a layoff now uh course you get six months uh unemployment from the state but what TI did for us is is uh i ive never heard of it before they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance uh computers a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us uh they had out of town newspapers and then the company and outside consultants didnt they have an outside consultant too i beg your pardon did they have an outside consultant like a uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while the employee uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us but the most important thing was that uh they had made up the difference between uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay and they then TI paid me that oh really so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off yeah they seem to be doing doing a good job of that im in facilities and and our organization vocalizednoise built builds those facilities over in Park Central now and i guess theyve been using them for six months now and ive known several engineers that got laid off and they said its like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after theyve been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh uh an assistance trying to find another job to have an office yeah yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job oh uhhuh well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably yeah apparently its very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyones doing well thats one of those little uh uh little extras that you dont see in the uh the the the handbook you know right youre absolutely right thats a good one what do you think about pensions anything on that or well now i have uh uh im getting close to retirement and of course ive been looking into it but uh since im only a yellow badger i wont be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a K account i ive been thinking about that for years uh ive never heard of such a thing i know thats what im saying that that pensions you see just like you were youre saying youve only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after youre vested and then just add the money together like you do with a K account you know uh yeah uh its your account period it doesnt matter where you go or anything thats your account to roll over i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didnt know there was such a thing no no there isnt i im saying thats the question what do you think could be better and im saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will i think they ought to have a pension at least that youd never lose you work for a company seven years yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security uh well social securitys going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and its not paid for by the current like when say we retire after the year two thousand social securitys paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel and you wont have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it its there you dont have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know yeah yeah thats just a thought i mean i uhhuh no i i like the idea course thats thats some something like an IRA if they say which yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i dont really know but i i can see where theyd need to do something on that because the statistics are you dont work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know you work for five six seven and you you a lot of people i know guys yeah that thats what ive done i ive bounced around about every ten years i change yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah ive only got uh ive got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then youd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh i havent used it i guess you im sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but im not im talking about major items i havent used it for anything major im glad its there though well knock wood i havent used mine anything for anything major just doctor visits and well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna i have the regular i again i just i havent i cant complain about it because i havent used it and every time i needed it it its uh its uh you know fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess im the one just supporting most of the others well doesnt it work that you dont see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum dont you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred uh yeah yeah i think its two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh yeah well now i have the same dental you have okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible uhhuh now see i dont have a deductible yeah right i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs well drugs are okay now im on that uh plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve oh that one i havent heard about yeah thats a typical thats a typical one thats in there the forms are right in personnel fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that its through Baxter Labs yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time every thirty days at a time well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i dont know whether you have to about an HMO i dont think so you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription and uh theyre twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year twelve dollars for a three months supply or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i dont want to say three months but its a lot cheaper allergy medicines really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe ive told you go something that you didnt know about in benefits laughterthere yeah vocalizednoise yeah i just might do that i do it yeah i you know its a very common thing its through Baxter Labs tell yeah well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it what else im sure were getting close to our five minutes whatever here yeah laughter uh lets see we discussed uh uh medical and dental what other benefits uh retirement yeah the salary continuation i think thats a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means youre really sick if you have to use that one what about vacation im satisfied with the vacation i dont know what else you know you nice to say you get another week and when im well i only got fourteen years so ill get another week when i hit fifteen uh yeah thats right so thats thats fair i mean its reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know well im uh im here ive got just eleven years and i dont think ill ever see a a silver badge i wont i wont be around that long well the way things go i think im going to have to work till im seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a parttime job

now are we off and running that you were saying sorry oh i was just saying i guess old age has a few compensations i dont have to plan as carefully as i used to but uh do you feel like you you took the steps that you you were glad that you took um earlier i mean would you have done anything differently no i dont think so uh we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and um thats thats quite a feat in todays laughter laughter economic situation thats wonderful um im sort of beginning in that score um we have a two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon so its its not easy putting enough aside but were doing a um our best to try and have fairly regular meetings to discuss at least where our goals are sometimes um it is less consistent than than it could be in terms of our ability to put money aside but um im im curious about the things that you did that that seemed to work best for you that youd pass on to somebody else laughter uh well as as advice the only way if if you spend all you take in every month youre uh living beyond your means thats right laughter and emergencies or what we could would consider an emergency uh always come up i i i dont care how how you how closely you think you figured and then planned something always comes up so uh when i i guess we started by necessity because we went to uh law school on my husbands GI Bill back in the days when uh the government paid uh the students tuition and and bought books up to a certain amount plus uh gave the veteran a stipend we started off with ninety dollars a month and then a little bit later got up to a hundred and five dollars a month so there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly stipend was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope deciding that it was better to go without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month umhum umhum and then uh later on  when we got out of school my husband got recalled into the Air Force when the Korean mess came up and uh so we had already established the envelope habit and uh and the envelope is your savings no no no this was our weekly budget oh okay but uh we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to buy cars and that sort of thing that we would have to save up beforehand uhhuh uhhuh so uh we uh uh began uh in nineteen fifty uh to pay cash for everything we bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three months so since then except for a house houses weve paid cash for everything and uh to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity to take care of special pricing uh our headquarters was transferred from South Carolina to Texas one time and because Texas gas was much much cheaper to cook with than electricity this one couple that we were transferred with uh bought a gas stove a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty some odd dollars we had uh in storage and used uh just a little teeny gas stove but after we got to Waco we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had uh was moving into a house with a built in oven had the very best stove that Sears made at the time with two ovens a grill in the middle on top clock all the fancy amenities uhhuh uhhuh and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars because we had the cash yes yeah and uh uh thats thats been the case for us with with uh cars and our preference recently has been used cars so its been nice to be able to negotiate when you have cash when youre buying a car well thats a thats a an important lesson do you feel like youve passed that along to your three kids given how different the economys been in their lives no unfortunately we have not except for one daughterinlaw and uh laughter rise up and call her blessed every day uh for some reason or other my husband didnt see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance he just felt he had to keep control control of the purse strings and uh when they went off to college they had never really budgeted and uh that that was a big mistake so even though you know your children are going to make mistakes uh i dont i dont know how to tell you

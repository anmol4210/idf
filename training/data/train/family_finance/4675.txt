all righty okay do you have a budget that you go on yeah i sure do um i have its pretty much a ledger sheet and i just write down vocalizednoise all my bills how much im going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount umhum umhum that way i know how much pocket change im going to have left laughterat laughterthe laughterend of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway umhum umhum so that works okay for me uhhuh well my bills i usually know approximately how much theyre going to be each month they vocalizednoise are more or less just about the same you know uhhuh same here uh very seldom are they any different and then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can laughterin the kitchen and then thats what we use to buy the groceries with oh okay and then we put our receipts in there you know and usually thats enough and um but i dont have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them right luckily i dont either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually thats not so much that it would throw me off yeah yeah right in fact i did have to take my dog to the vet the other day laughterbut laughteryou so you know what im saying yeah  yeah that its its worse than having a kid huh i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing ive ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so yeah um im not working right now i worked for P I E and then uh they went bankrupt so i just went ahead and took my early pension oh uhhuh but i only get that once a month ooh thats tough yeah laughter my roommate only gets paid once a month yeah so and that last weeks pretty lean generally laughterspeaking so yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i dont go over that amount you know each month right i for for years got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once theres always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones umhum umhum but i would pay all of them at one sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it yeah right and and that worked okay for me i dont know right now i im in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is and so oh yeah right now its terrible isnt it its yeah its really bad but um its going pretty well and ive got a real good plan mapped out here so uhhuh i also like belong to a Christmas club because you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didnt then so then naturally Christmas comes along and thats puts you behind too you know so this year now i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club oh thats so i figure you know thats gonna help some thatll cover your gifts come Christmas time thatll yeah yeah right you know thatd be good because yeah most people are spending three or four months digging you know at least digging out after Christmas so yeah right right and im taking yeah i i was pretty fortunate this Christmas i didnt get in debt so oh thats good im taking like um sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can so i wont have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore oh uhhuh its so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer i know i even bought myself a Surger you know and i just love it i havent learned everything to do on it yet but i figure that will help me save yeah vocalizednoise you know my um roommate does sew some and and um i she hasnt sewed anything in a long time but i im sure that she could pick it up again my mother always sewed she tried to teach me when i was young but not interested laughter yeah well see some people are and some people arent because i have some sisters i have three sisters and none of those are really interested in sewing yeah but thats a real good way to save money though by doing that yeah and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales umhum umhum so which ive been doing well thats a good way to to make a little extra money well this is another way that im making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and youre actually my first call oh really oh i had not um well have you called i i guess todays todays my first day that i could even do it oh it is yeah you beat me to the punch here oh well thats nice thats nice you know i was i was about to call to get to see if i could get on with somebody so so that was great well i guess thats about all i can talk to about budgets when i was working i uh bought a bond a month out of my you know they automatically took it out of my out of my uh payroll yeah i take have some money taken out vocalizednoise and put in a K

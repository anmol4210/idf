okay Janet do you guys have a family budget we try to laughter like mothers im sitting im right this minute dishing up cheap spaghetti which is one way we try and keep within a budget laughter its probably why were participating too right laughter although im trying to raise money for a boy scout cause um actually how we do it is my husband and i both work and we try very hard to live on his salary and my salary goes automatically into a savings account which we try not to use too much although from that we both definitely we typically pay our credit cards from that account so thats the thats the uh our household expenses are pretty well covered because theyre pretty much the same every month but its our credit card spending that its always the problem yep is the cost of living uh high down there is it tough to i dont know what to compare it to i lived in Indiana and Saint Louis but i was a student then and you know when youre a student things dont mean much um i think Dallas is um i know its just a  relatively high priced homes but then theres not i think energy and some of the other things arent quite so high and i my my gestalt is that our groceries are sort of intermediate therere not as bad as i have seen in big cities like New York or California areas how about you um the cost of living here is cheap in in fact its really great weve got a a quite a nice home weve got a five bedroom home home with a basement in it and it cost me through let me see four years ago it cost me fifty five thousand so its great i mean uh uh that is laughter where are you from originally right here in Idaho from from Idaho yes ive got a brother in law in Plano Texas and thats how we got hooked up with this uh TI deal but its well i dont know anyone from Idaho im from Indiana um and i have a great love for the Midwest would go back in a minute if i could laughterbut i married a Texan they dont always tell you that they have a homing instinct well thats good but i our home uh we have a five bedroom home um but its more in the range of with around two hundred forty thousand so about four and a half times your home im sure theyre probably quite comparable yeah right or maybe i dont know ours is nice our home is nicely located but i dont think the house itself is yeah well i i wouldnt uh mines not nicely located i probably got a bargain i think more particularly extraordinary  how about budget wise how how do you do a family budget are you married yes i am and my wife is very meticulous about budgeting she has a computer program in fact im an accountant im a CPA im calling you from work tonight uh but uh my wife runs every single check she spends through a computer and she can tell me on a monthly basis and shes more interested not me in fact i only look at it once a year when i do our we do our taxes but she can tell you every month exactly what shes paid for groceries and uh utility bills and for gasoline in the cars and everything shes uh uh my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we used the Managing Your Money software package with Andrew Tobias he is familiar with that one yeah im not im not uhhuh well i mean now im sure there are a million software packages but um he tried very hard and we were all computerized and we our regular monthly checks we printed you know um and i hated i did it for three years and hated every minute of it laughter and still founded about half of our checks maybe a third i still hand wrote because it would be like in the school parking lot or you know at my childs skating lesson or something like that so we had to come we had two checks two sizes of checks vocalizednoise excuse me baside Beth right there easide my daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is um so we we tried and it was pretty nice one of one mistake i think we made in that is that um for budgeting purposes in terms of putting it in a budget we must have had eighty different categories and so they they became sort of nonsensical instead of i always said if we had redone it we should have just put big categories like utilities and you know luxuries laughterand entertainment that sort of thing we have about twenty five categories is all probably and we write all of our checks out of the register we dont try to do any through the computer and then my wife just sets down when shes got about an hour and just keys them all in and its really not you know that bad it um well i dont know it might it mightve been tough for you but she enjoys it and thats another thing too she really enjoys it she uh laughter well i see laughter i suppose thats the key um just gets a thrill out of seeing where her money went i guess do you does your wife work outside the home she does shes she teaches at um a small two year college here shes uh teaches uh business communications oh my goodness well with a CPA and a business person you should be organized uh yeah uh laughteri laughterdont laughterknow we still have problems with money like everybody else

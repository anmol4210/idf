 card yourself or uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years weve tried to cut them back a little laughterbit and and uh down to mainly mainly one each uh uh its its easy to let them get out of control laughteryeah its i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and seen people with you know theyve had well ive seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits and about twenty thousand dollars of it used and i and we weve got one but its just for absolute laughteremergencies we hardly ever use it oh vocalizednoise laughter yeah yeah thats uh thats what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those for sure yeah they uh they can like you laughtersay you can once you start using them they theyre always real real willing to raise those limits for you laughter thats for sure yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they dont have to be as credit conscious they can no they can afford to write off a lot more yeah they can write off a lot more losses now uh which which i kind of disagree uh with id rather them going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates yeah  thats  excuse me yeah thats true i uh well i cant see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i cant imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because theres yeah i ive heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have yeah well that make you you know that makes sense i guess if theyre theyre not willing to write off as much but you know it theres a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we sent well take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars cost or a year for the just the fee and everything it yeah  i dont know i just i have a hard time i like i say i working in a financial institution i just im really rate conscious i guess and cant see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy well yeah well well people people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they dont look at at spending uh eighteen percent laughter on on credit its uh for some reason they dont look at it that way yep theres i imagine theres theres quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they dont have to charge you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that cant pay it off monthly and get thats thats true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them off but theres sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them off but yeah thats true but the people who who cant afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it its sort of like the federal government laughter laughteryeah laughterexactly thats true but yeah i uh i i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt theyve got it just seems like theyre they right now they cant afford to buy anymore because theyre up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know thats part of the reason i think everythings kind of stalled out but yes thats right well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh uh i think it would only mean that theyd theyd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and theyd probably make just as much money they just wouldnt write off as many losses that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass through through that through Congress they the thing that Congress didnt realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to pick things up but it would just it do wouldnt do any good because you know the banks arent stupid theyre going to realize that they cant you know they cant keep affording to write off five percent if theyre only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent yeah thats thats right yes uh well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didnt look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and thats in uh in real estate and other things and its the same with credit cards thats true thats true i dont know what will happen like i say were sure trying we we just got the one and we just dont want to get any more yeah we i i use a company one somewhat uh uh to to uh do air travel and all but uh i make sure that ones always uh paid off because im responsible for the interest on that one if laughter if i dont pay it off uh uh if its not huh huh where do you work at i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you dont have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so oh do you uh yeah so you just use your card but its but its in your name so its up to you to pay it off and and because its American Express you cant run up a a credit on it so that turn in the voucher

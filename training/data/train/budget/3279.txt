 okay ive got a you know i have a real good method of starting to get the budget balanced again and thats get half of the government rid of the half the government payroll  i think that would probably  uh be very possible and and and we really wouldnt feel it in our laughterservices not all i you know i dont know if youve ever been to Washington DC yes i have uh you youve seen that which was on there and the offices and in light of these uh hearings weve all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed they really dont laughterhave enough to keep them busy and keep their noses at in their own business and what theyre doing and the other thing is uh besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid  i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us  i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget uh again being just a voter voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman i dont think theres too much that im gonna be able to do about it but  i believe in taking an active part in politics so well i one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the um  regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income and then  the uh corporate yeah industries just dont seem to not pay proportionally  i think that that would would help a lot i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things but  i dont know its just hard to  hard to take um you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use and uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction  yeah they dont they dont seem to well i really think the biggest problem and then the Taft Rudman Act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what theyre doing  i mean this nonsense thats coming through now about uh uh lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to to boost the economy because people have no more money is its it its ridiculous if they dont laughterhave laughterthat laughtermoney now bringing in less is not gonna help the problem as far as the government not not gonna help its never never helped my my personal laughtersituation laughteri i cant say it would help theirs either laughter yeah and thank God we dont operate our budget the way they operate theirs or wed all be in in dire trouble laughter were were being serious  but thats uh  yeah i dont know what were gonna be able to do about it but i guess its been around so long that its sort of like our mortgages i dont ever expect to pay mine off before i die so i guess laughterwhy laughtershould laughterthe laughtergovernment laughtertry vocalizednoise laughter oh laughter isnt thats the way theyre thinking these days anyway it seems seems to be i you know i it really does bother me when i think about vocalizednoise you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh a national problem that we cant seem to find an an answer to it i i dont know i i dont think it ever will really i maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense really if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic you know intergovernmental intergovernmental or interUnited States type programs that i wouldnt really mind i i believe in paying my share and i dont mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that  people are entitled to but i just i just sometimes feel like im being used  but uh  again i dont think well be able to do anything about it so  well that thats quite possible i guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit or itll just totally get even more out of control but i  i dont know yeah bite the bullet it sounds like you have a baby there yeah i i do shes a were not feeling too well over here so that  yeah oh really  oh thats a shame shes not the one going to Washington huh no no shes  i dont think i could part with her oh laughter laughter laughterokay okay Jerry  okay weve probably been on long enough they didnt cut us off but i think thatll probably do it so it was nice talking to you  okay well thanks bye bye  okeydoke byebye

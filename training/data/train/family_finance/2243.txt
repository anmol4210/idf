what kind of coins do you primarily collect um basically i my preference is Arab and ancient coins hum ive got a uh ive got a few i dont know i dont know i dont even know if theyre real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box im mostly into uh American gold and silver dollars and stuff like that oh very interesting um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so ive got a few of those tucked away but um your Greek and Roman coins might you know if if theyre um in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them out and i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well ill take them with me and let somebody look at them they just they just feel phony you know they feel like theyre made of lead or something and uh they dont have any sort of its its got a its got a like a picture on it but theres no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else that would be the Greek ones okay because i think most the Roman ones have had something on them right right so this yeah it had a it had a had a has a bust of somebody on there but uh no sort of identifying marks or anything um it the are they silver or no i dont no theyre not theyre its its too heavy for silver its its more like lead i think fairly soft oh interesting yeah i think theyre fakes laughter did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily probably laughter i dont know where they got them from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things its probably about thirty or forty of them in there gee thats yeah they laughter you might be sitting on a gold mine wouldnt that be something right um i dont know a lot about um Greek and Roman although im a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so ive picked up a bit but um if it if theyre really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them Lydian coins and um gosh all these years ive been thinking they were fakes maybe theyre real laughter right i dont uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes you know if you go to um uh a fight and then the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night umhum laughter but um i think thats fairly recent phenomena probably sounds like some of the coin dealers i know now now laughter theyre supposed to theyre supposed to be licensed and the um above board right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you laughterknow oh i see laughter oh and you made your own yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them last night laughter heres a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year laughter was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold yeah that they they are gold theyre just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value and amazingly enough youre youre into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon oh really is that uh still still true yeah still is yeah thats sort of like a cottage industry industry over there uh and and theres some very specific things you can find you can even narrow narrow it down to where it was made i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one and uh you you can almost tell the area somebody probably even knows the guy who made them you mean make i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody cant say you know when hes selling them that somebody else made it i mean its so that he gets his own profits yeah well the  yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them sell these things and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit laughter and thats always very difficult oh i see otherwise the the buyer is responsible i mean responsible well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if its an unscrupulous dealer hell just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know its yours course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but youd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldnt fraud is very difficult to prove umhum umhum because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it and thats all hes got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin so you know its his word against mine right right thats one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on oh thats interesting because im more interested in the research and im doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the six and seven hundreds and so and so im not into the the buying and selling business um it sounds like im wise laughter laughter yes yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh grading systems have changed over the last few years thats primarily what got me out of it they they kept changing the grading systems on coins and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection and youve graded it at the current grade and then the next year theyve changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them you know its just it it just got it just got ludicrous after a while umhum umhum what what what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them as M S sixty five then by golly theyre M S sixty five i dont care what you say umhum umhum and theyll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them at inflated laughterprices umhum i think thats thats the the hardest thing is that people who dont really know feel sometimes a sometimes for example i know um you know the ancients better but because its old they figure its got to cost you know thousands of dollars oh yeah yeah i mean its really its it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um Indian head pennies you know and they say wow you know this is really old yeah well its not worth anything laughter laughter ill give you a nickel for it laughteryou laughterknow and even even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces right right and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars oh really i didnt know that oh yeah yeah theyre cheap theyre super cheap oh that several i mean its its it its funny the way the business works because therere so many things that are enormously out priced some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them are are worth hundreds of dollars you know and and the coins themselves arent worth very much at all face value basically and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and its traded for silver so basically if if someone isnt really interested in the coins its not some an investment no its its more of a uh its a commodity purchase really uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do find some some uh nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books can fill a whole bunch of them with these uh with these bags uh especially you you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um id give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced um but i used to go through i id get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh about about twelve bags of these things and id gone through all of them and i found a couple of them i found a nineteen O nine VDB and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce i found several good ones out of there peoples giving it to me for two cents i uh thats okay turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars laughter

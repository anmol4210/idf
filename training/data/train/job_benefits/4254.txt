well uh vocalizednoise i guess that was it um i guess the uh its interesting that they asked the benefits question i think because uh we just merged with another um division in our company and actually have different slightly different benefits so i guess the the things id look for um kind of things i call like safety net features like health insurance and uh possibly um retirement pension sorts of incentives and then i guess theres the things for like personal growth like uh educational reimbursement tuition like tuition reimbursement or uh maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness center or something like that would be yeah but vocalizednoise be interested in seeing i think its important to have some place to go over the years in a within a company uh i work for uh a university but we do defense contracts and  with my job theres not much place to go i mean theres not theres not what youre hired in as is what you end up as and the benefits are okay but id rather have more security thats interesting yeah i i was actually at uh Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh doing uh um i guess on research staff there and i i got a feeling that uh you know there wasnt really it wasnt really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like vocalizednoise a doctorate in something and then you could you know look at the youd be eligible for the uh you know the uh are are you uh with with a university system now more important position than you are well vocalizednoise well no im not im sorry im at uh im actually doing um consulting in the commercial um what in in industry when i say it was a i like security but what we did was a uh mostly radar some counter stuff for Russians and things so i dont really exactly have a whole lot of laughtersecurity laughterright laughternow well thats interesting since uh theyre not doing so good theyre not a threat anymore so yeah but it seems like other uh the other people that are on the verge or already have missiles that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection yeah im im  most all those systems are the same they came were originated Soviet Union so oh okay so its not viewed as thats interesting its not real good you have good good benefits like vacation days does that mean much to you um actually i never thought of that i i i i guess i assumed thats part of the uh package but um i guess if the salary was you know enough then i might just make my own you know take the unpaid time off but uh um as long as you know its not uh i guess whats more important than vacation is actually having the time to use it because a lot of times were in projects where you know where the dates are critical and its its a little harder to plan a vacation when youre in that kind of environment we have it pretty good because i we we take our vacation anytime we want by the hour by the day its good i really like that if its a pretty day uh if the works not pressing i go fishing yeah vocalizednoise that means a lot to me it it it takes a lot of the stress of the job out too so so like a consistent work load would that be kind of a vocalizednoise is that vocalizednoise i dont know if thats considered a benefit its just in kind of part of the environment youre in vocalizednoise well were spaced in timing too uh when we get toward the end of a contract then its uh you cant leave and were always behind time behind schedule out of money you have to donate your time and we charge you know about four accounting purposes to the projects so theres no way that that you can take off vacation and charge it back to the project yeah huh so theyre out of money so i dont know my next job i think im going to look at health insurance closer than i did this one yeah it its only been a problem i guess in our organization seems like um about the year after i joined was when they started passing on a lot higher percentage of the increases they were getting from the carriers but ive got an HMO um with mine because ive got vocalizednoise what what sort of monthly uh uh charges are uh are you uh married do you have family yeah uh one were growing another um a little boy on the way it looks like all right well whats your monthly for your uh the health insurance so uh uh lets see its um like thirty dollars a pay period so its every two weeks so its about

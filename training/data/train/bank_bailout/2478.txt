Colorado Springs oh right up in uh TI out there oh right did you hit one yeah i just hit one then all right the savings and loan scandal it i i got to uh this is going to be fun are you Republican or Democrat kind of neither okay well i was i was im a Democrat so i was going to say if youre a Republican boy we would really have a good time i do have some Republican leanings because i am division one you know laughter well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money and theyre the ones wasting all the money and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know i get a kick out of that but anyway the subject go ahead you first uh i think its a stinking shame that that there isnt capital punishment for those assholes that stole our money yeah i uh i dont think its over i think that uh so many other things have taken over uh in the media but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know i agree with you i think it had something to do with deregulation but i believe uh more of it was just greed yeah i was talking to someone i cant remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and uh yeah there there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as im concerned not just a couple you know weve watched and watched TV and seen that a lot of these people were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit but financing the same property three and four times you know and the list goes on and on well i i agree a hundred percent you know of of just the crimes committed oh yeah much less for criminals that should be indicted it may have started with HUD too i noticed that HUD was in terrible shape and that was property and uh they lost a lot of money there and then some of these big these rich people started to even uh Murchison here who owned the Cowboys had a lot of property down in Florida this was several years ago and he lost you know all all of his money before he died not all of it i dont know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would vocalizednoise it always would increase you know it always would uh uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all yeah it everyone forgets whose money it was and everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word as far as being a Republican or a Democrat i think no American could stand for criminal action well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all uh Reaganomics for you know you spend your way to prosperity and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought thats not going to work you know and i knew that it wasnt going to work originally and it hasnt worked now you know in theory in theory a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on right no doubt no doubt if people are making money people can spend money and itll generate taxes oh yeah i i i agree with that but theres got to be some control and apparently there was you know well the problem is and the problem with Reaganomics is the people at the top are the ones getting rich for what they would cost and we werent producing anything we as Americans werent producing anything it was all inflation and im sorry we dont get into a real argument over it we agree too closely but yeah i know uh laughter laughter but you you cant say that that was right oh no i no intelligent person can say we could spend our way rich remember all were doing is delivering pizzas to each other and and not high quality ones at that you know yeah well well i do have a lot of confidence in the the American people and the economy and everything else i i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at TI you know and i think that the it it still a lot of the workers dont understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know it is a life and death struggle with Japanese with the Japanese i i know and and i when i of course im in facilities and i work with a lot of mechanics and i just cannot understand why theyre just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well im paid anyway so it doesnt matter you know i im very tired of it all pays by the hour right right and im nonexempt yeah oh really you dont sound like a nonexempt Jim is so you dont sound like a nonexempt what what does a nonexempt sound like uh youre too informed theyre theyre very theyre very uh not interested they wouldnt even talk probably about some of the things were talking about now i guess im dealing with too many Texas mechanics here i dont know really im im being a Yankee i guess im im letting my Yankee come out you know uh thats well i now maybe im not the uh typical nonexempt that you deal with the badge is silver and uh i am degreed though nonexempt uh well thats good no laughter thats not laughtergood but no right i mean thats good that youre degreed uh uh your time will come there we uh i know a few people that would no i i do not wish my time to come oh really what are you in a tech like do you do technician technician work or something or oh no no i government tool control is my specialty now i did PC protection control work for uh oh quality okay ten or twelve years uh right now im just trying to tool crib and hauling chips times are bad oh yeah well now is is uh really terrible i im uh management level uh facilities and when the cuts came three of us got uh bounced back and so were just uh im calling you from work i i i im im covering uh weekends and nights now im im one of the manager reps theres three of us to cover in Dallas facilities and just were essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends thats my i only get one weekend off a month right now i call it my recession job laughter its uh being vocalizednoise basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well theres not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on they turned all installation up here off they told facilities they could not work i dont care what the jobs are you will not work yeah it it and and as far as our you know our conversation goes i would really be interested to know how much of TIs problems now are related to the banking structure i think that not not only TI but a lot of it when they talk about uh there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i i have to admit im not as informed uh that much but theres something like eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well if they claim that its going to cost us eighty six billion its got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if thats true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere it really hurts me yeah its amazing really its amazing that to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values oh yeah i know what you mean uh one of our course your value of homes up there are pretty good i mean here theyre not really that high but are they pretty good up there oh really our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart well were in the metroplex here you know and uh it it i die every time companies like General Dynamics they they lost several contracts and and i dont know if you noticed yesterday you probably dont pay attention to the Bell Helicopter you know they were going to have this big uh award and Secorski got it which was Boeing Secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know yeah its northwest Seattle Seattle and also uh they do some of that in Wichita Kansas and i dont know how Bell didnt get it well i i dont i they were advertising here that it was Bell TI TI was getting the uh electronics with Bell and so it was a double one that Bell is in the Metroplex and two that TI was doing the electronics for them and they they uh advertised that that it was TI Bell TI Bell and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah Secorski Boeing Boeing doesnt need the money Secorski Boeing something i almost think theres some politics around here because the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the uh with TI i dont know if TI has lost as much as everybody else but General Dynamics and LTV and Bell have lost project after project you know well you realize

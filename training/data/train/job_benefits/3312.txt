 kind of options do you have in your work  uh as far as other than salary like the fringe benefits um  we get of course insurance paid  we get our sick leave and and holidays paid thats nice uh earn vacation and uh of course the work place is is uh very uh its a very nice area to work in um how about you well we dont get much laughter you dont no we dont um we have to pay for our own insurance and we you know we do get the vacation but we dont get sick pay until weve been there a year and then um i think it starts after four days if youve been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay  and uh um its real tough  the for benefits vocalizednoise the sick leave is according according to the status the way youre employed it has something to with the the way you earn your sick leave and uh you dont automatically get it depends on your status uh but uh really cant complain course the cost of uh living keeps going up salaries remain about the same and your laughtermedical benefits go up also thats the truth uhhuh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference it it surely does especially if you have a family i dont but i know when you have children and you dont it can get to be quite expensive yeah i dont have any children but i do have my husband gets um insurance paid through his company but its still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his is that right gee i i didnt realize that until hes been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that but a little better but um right now  well do you think then salary is the most important no i really dont i really think that benefits um help out a lot you know with the positions um uh benefits you know like you said are are almost better you know thats a lot of pay thats true if you thought if you think about health because i think my husband and i went to um get health insurance from an outside agency once and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month  yes to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference i know that my parents recently retired well not recently maybe the last six eight years and uh they had to uh buy a policy until something kicked in at a certain age and they were paying an enormous amount of money per month it is unbelievable in order to maintain it really is and then my mom and dad have that Blue Blue Cross Blue Shield and i think that goes up every month laughter  oh yeah that is just something else because theyre you know at the retirement age and and thats something too thats just unbelievable i know some of the companies when you do retire youre able to carry forward your retire your insurance benefits oh well that would be great wouldnt that be wonderful that would be nice laughter yes it would but uh i dont know i dont know what else would there be besides your insurance and your holiday paid and yeah my my husband gets uh life insurance dental insurance and um life and dental and and health  yeah and then he also gets legal help legal aid oh uhhuh and he also gets like hes entered into a credit union and oh yeah we have that and and all that that kind of helps out uh now thats true now weve started the EA where you can um if you have like a mental health problem a drug problem or what have you uh mentally they they will provide services for that now too and thats wonderful uh well thats nice my my sister where she works has the HMO oh yes uhhuh which is something thats you know its nice but you know its great because you pay five dollars and you go and and your medicine is five dollars but if its not an emergency you wait three months is that right well to get in umhum and that is um trying to think which one that is but im not its a real popular one hum is it like Cigna or but um Kaiser Kaiser well we have that option at at work uh to choose that or to stay with our our company that uh TI has desired to administer the insurance program but uh you can either go with the HMO or stay with with Aetna yeah i im going with Aetna thats what im im staying with well im just going to stay with the um you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and thats it but yeah because she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if its not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in  well see now your eye doctors paid for through the HMO yes yes vocalizednoise ours isnt well i dont know about the HMO but through Aetna it is not covered no its not yeah my isnt either but through the HMO it is oh thats interesting and i think eyes and and about every doctor you could about

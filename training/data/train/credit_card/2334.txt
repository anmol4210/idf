had well you should try it well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going and this was back in the eighties i dont know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that but uh i had a coin shop and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom you lost your business oh God what a laughternightmare yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bankruptcy you know it was one of those things  uh oh itll get better next week you know  things will pick up and so there i was in old bankruptcy court well you werent charging gold and silver were you you cant do that can you oh yeah yeah oh you can  oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it  oh thats a nightmare  yeah course on on stuff that i was vocalizednoise on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because i was selling it i wasnt buying you know just to hold onto it but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up well  i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college theyll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them all out because youre honored laughterright and uh i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well thats okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right  i wasnt thinking a thing about it umhum yes thats the way they suck you in yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because you know got get such good bargains  and i dont know   well just today in the mail i got uh i got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express oh yeah weve been getting those i went back to school and got my Masters and they started sending those things to me again yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name yeah they did and uh course i guess i guess ive been purged from their records i used to have an American Express uh back when i had my business i got one they they goofed up bad on my first on my very first bill because i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses and the bill would come in and id pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying youre overdue pay so i i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didnt do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier and said were going to turn this over to our attorneys if you dont pay and i looked at that and i said uhhuh so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks and now they werent check in yeah they were i tell you they dont talk about they were charging that enormous fee every year now what is it now its up to fifty five on the gold card its eighty five for the Optima oh im sorry no fifty fifty what do you mean fifty five you mean fifty five dollars yeah for the green card and it but then whats the interest well now and thats thats the card fee and interest is like eighteen or something oh yeah yeah its um well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isnt any but on the Optima card its um  lets see right now its running at about its not too bad its actually its about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go credit cards  well theyre dangerous you know my parents dont hardly

exactly laughter uh plastic is just too easy i mean thats the thats the whole problem with it um have well and youre tempted if youve got cash a little bit of cash and you dont have enough for the purchase right of course you got to charge it and keep your cash naturally thats i got in all kinds of trouble doing that laughter baside what what are you saying easide oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i i dont really usually consider that an option laughter maybe thats how we got in laughtertrouble having having having been out of the credit game for some years now ive ive gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it and uh yeah but its hard isnt it well it is but i i im kind of uh grateful for the experience because its taught me a lot of restraint well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic yeah exactly i i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday with cash with cash and it its do you work with TI no no i wish i did laughter yeah you could have got a discount couldnt you yeah i could use a discount laughter i have to wait for the things to go on sale laughter  but theres always a sell yeah especially on electronic goods especially now what is that thing i saw Circuit Circuit world or something oh Circuit City Circuit City have you been in that  yeah they theyre not their prices arent that terrific they they used to be but theyve gotten theyve got to pay for all that national advertising now oh its national i think ive seen two around Dallas yeah theyre theyre all over the country now they uh they they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains well what else  i dont know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise yeah in Garland you you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now so so much for Circuit City  okay what else can we talk about who do you work for i dont im a graduate student im a professional student  sounds wonderful we were talking about that just today it is its its great we

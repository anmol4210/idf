 well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago my husband was raised here but i i have never lived here so um when when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasnt a state income tax and there wasnt a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so  im sort of feeling like were getting a better laughterdeal here than what i was accustomed to yeah well did you move from the the Northeast well i lived in Missouri and then in Utah and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax and um weve always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store so i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries groceries and  but i think i mean i i dont enjoy paying taxes and its hard but um i think thats what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and  excuse me and have and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess what i feel is that most people um they dont like to pay taxes because they feel like well theres some people who arent paying their fair share yeah i think yeah its the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to laughter  and um that makes you feel bad right and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know i i didnt have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um it was kind of hard for me to think heres someone who as wealthy as he is didnt have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed  he had didnt have to pay income tax and he thought well you know theres some people are living pretty pretty good life styles but theyre not paying income tax and thats not fair to me and theres you know some people who uh are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um im willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries ive studied and visited and um im willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i dont think theres probably any really put that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed you know i guess in Texas with uh we live here also and that its mostly sales tax so its really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because theyre paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff ive lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year were there it was like eight hundred dollars and were like oh no laughter you know what laughterhappened laughteris my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas and now laughter you know so i mean that was kind of different and then to file a laughter uhhuh a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since weve been married weve moved a lot and so it always seems like you know were always paying in taxes for something and so the it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back but i um have accounting background so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked  for accounting firm and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places  they dont have to pay taxes or to buy something that loses money so that they can you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if i can understand maybe why the rich people dont want to pay you know a large large percent because it you know thats not really fair either if theyve earned their money by themselves well you know people  just kind of given the laughtermoney its kind of depressing sometimes i think well it is and um and sometimes i think um well for myself that the income that we have were paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind thisll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think were you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way were compensated um just by our society yet you know they dont pay you um what just what it would take and then if if you pay taxes on it you wouldnt have any money left over and  and um but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would laughteri guess because im not one of them laughter i wish that they would um you know realize that they well yeah thats laughtertrue they couldnt make this kind of money they couldnt live that kind of life style anywhere else in that even if they made that kind of money theres some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they wouldnt be able to enjoy the uproots that and that so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it yes theyve earned it and yes theyve thats great theyve you know had such great fortune here but they need to pay for it too because they couldnt do that somewhere else um um i like Texas um not having the state income tax and i hope that because um you know that weve had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we dont laughter the industry here is able to to um fund the state because we have oil here and things i mean thats what ive always heard is that um but they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really hasnt been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes i wouldnt think big boom  yeah theres something about um the industry in the state that um theres enough i know we moved here from Houston and um the city had its enough money it was really nice that they had uh but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would have have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community country club type things that the it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city and i really liked that dont you have to why people just kind of debate expect certain services then then they dont really think they should pay for them or something maybe i dont know yeah its true and im you know like the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri but um im im comfortable at least this year with we pay we have some good schools you know the school thing might be changing but im im willing to pay for that for my children and im willing to sacrifice i guess i mean im not going to be the kind of person thats going to grumble about the taxes even though were paying pretty high percentage um i feel like you get what you pay for and i want to be here and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country and having seen other countries id much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and and not anyway well laughter laughteri guess i better let you go laughter well it was nice talking to you i havent ever i need to ive never initiated one of these phone calls do you call in do you get to pick the subject or do they kind of yeah it was nice talking no no they just define it to you and so so you get what get uh luck of the draw but laughter yeah laughter anyway well good luck to you byebye  oh i see okay you too bye

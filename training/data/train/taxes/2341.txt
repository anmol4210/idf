the taxes tend to uh keep going up but uh i dont know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well theres always someone thats  thats worse off in what they end up paying but uh go ahead i think i think were always convinced that were paying too much in taxes without getting back necessarily everything wed like to but so far i dont think ive paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet yeah im still still im able to survive and and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money its almost like youre paying your own salary i dont work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days its still uh still a feeling of you know its not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way uh that helps the rationale any but its still angering to see the abuses uh even though theyre uh a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when theyre you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and whats happening in that area its still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes desire that that money not be spent well do you all pay state income tax no no Texas doesnt have a state income tax yet thats neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part theyve just started talking about introducing a state income tax and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent well by the time the city gets involved im not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent so its its pretty pretty much but i think its divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some and its its quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere but were in a particular part of the state thats pretty well off so its its like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes well thats good yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and theres a lot of lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so its its a real mixed blessing i guess to thats i think thats the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots and i i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again yeah itd be nice if you could find someone uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then youd have to find a way to make it work laughter i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R laughter yeah yeah the uh bureaucracy seems to spend more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic cant see the forest for the trees i i wonder if if they realize so it make the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and well have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever and they just keep trying to to close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all theyre doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse and i dont i dont think theyre getting their moneys worth and i i i definitely dont think that the added steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think its just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws they will find a way if they want to badly enough theyll either find it themselves or theyll find someone to do it for them it does seem to be the case i dont know whether its worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every dollar you make or spend it gets uh steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everythings going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction i dont know what what would happen if we uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving its not a you know a tax your income because now youre talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff but if you put the burden on the retailer who really doesnt care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesnt care who bought the groceries youre going to pay the tax on it so vocalizednoise most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our income income brackets right laughter so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didnt save they wouldnt have to get or what they could could save they wouldnt get taxed on and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way its so simple that people would be afraid to try it yeah but you wouldnt be able to steer people toward a particular type of savings you wouldnt be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRAs and all that they you wouldnt be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money and it didnt have the taxation problem well you might might do all right i dont know it seems yeah even if you didnt invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest you youd still be ahead thats for sure and thats something thats something i need to to learn a lot more about is is under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future because thats a thats a scary thought you always hear that Social Security wont be around by the time were sixty three or sixty five and and need it and thats a scary thought thats true plus what what there will be of it even if its there isnt quite enough anyway laughterso youre looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didnt go away yeah the uh the taxes are are kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things weve written into it but uh looking looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there its not all that pleasant anywhere we still look pretty good dont we yeah pretty much well i hear one of my kiddos doing something they shouldnt be so ill uh let you go and maybe its been nice talking to you maybe maybe well catch each other again okay have a good evening ill try bye thanks byebye

uh do you work yes i do what do you do uh im a data manager at a manufacturing company that makes landing gear oh well do they have good job benefits yes they do very good uh comparable i used to work for TI and i used to work for Martin Marietta and they are comparable to them um as good or better what do do you work no i dont oh okay uh i said my husband works on the railroad theyve got a lot of benefits but its expensive this uh the insurance is a kick in the tail every month well i uh my insurance is is very reasonable where i work and course the it would well the insurance is good we only have to pay like a hundred dollar deductible per year its just its uh its like a hundred dollars a month oh is it really yeah well i mean well thats just well i i chose an HMO and mine only runs five dollars a uh five dollars a month well this is uh like retirement benefits and its a bunch of different benefits in one its not just oh i see its not just medical insurance okay well i pay five dollars a month for my medical and then we have a retirement uh benefits package a profit sharing type of thing they match our uh we can put in up to fifteen percent and theyll match uh sixteen six percent one hundred percent you know so that is thats better than most companies do thats great yeah thats good plus plus they you know we have bonds we have a credit union its a fairly its not a real large company well it is its part of a large company its a subsidiary of a large company and  whoops im sorry we have three different thats my calls waiting theyll just have to call back uh we have uh uh were part of a im sorry company in  we have a company in California and a company in Canada and this company here and uh so we have about five hundred employees at each place they do uh so its thats about fifteen hundred all together then we but were a a subsidiary of a of a larger company so we have all the benefits that all the big large companies have i dont know any that we dont have i dont know a lot about benefits most of the jobs that ive had you know were  i dont have a degree i quit college when i first got pregnant with my little boy oh uhhuh i plan on going back  just i want to wait for my kids to grow up now and uh uh im sorry laughter so all ive had was mainly fast food jobs and i worked at a toy store and i worked at TI for a while but it was for Manpower so thats all right oh uhhuh  i liked working at TI i worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Florida and worked at Martin Marietta in Orlando for four years and then i got oh youre in Florida i was no im in Texas uh i left Martin Marietta for this company here in Fort Worth its im in Grapevine right now but oh okay i work in Fort Worth and they just offered me such a fantastic deal i i just couldnt turn it down there wasnt any way i could turn it down they they moved me and they paid for every i mean they paid for everything my license my drivers license my all my utilities at my home plus you know paying to move my furniture and my license tags everything i just you know and plus a huge salary increase and i thought God id be stupid if i dont take this and i wanted to come back to Texas anyway so  well thats great and like i say they have all those same benefits that Martin Marietta and TI had so um what did you say you did again a computer a data im a data manager and it well i took data processing in college oh did no this is a lot of people think that it has something to do with computers and it really doesnt i mean i do have a computer but it it really doesnt have anything to do with computers its data that uh is generated like reports test reports financial reports all kinds of reports that that uh a project would generate uh now its my job to see that contractually contractually these people you know deliver them on time and i have to make sure that they they do get delivered and thats thats what my job is and its thats that kind of data instead of instead of computer data well that sounds great though what did you do at TI yeah uhhuh i was a a configuration manager at at TI which was similar well it was uh similar but wasnt i mean i it was uh doing uh it was a little bit more technical configuration management management its a little bit more technical than what im doing now and i liked it but it was a it was a job that i always felt like i didnt have control of you know what i mean i never felt like id mastered that job and when i moved to Florida i moved down there as a configuration manager and stayed there from uh stayed at that job for quite a while until i got an opportunity to go into data management which i and ive been in that ever since and love it i mean thats just my cup of tea the configuration manager was oh i hate to feel out of control of anything oh i do too and i really did id sit there and you know when people asked me what i did i never could really tell them what i did because i didnt know because i you know laughter i was doing the job laughter you played it by ear and i was getting good raises and my laughterboss even goes you even got non periodic raises but i really just felt so control out of control so but anyway im and i like i say ive always been with a company thats had a lot of benefits so uh and and when you get older now i know when youre younger my daughter just doesnt realize it but i wish i had when i was younger thought about retirement but you know you think oh thats twenty years away from now whos going to worry about it well i well me and my husband are weve talked about it were having six dollars a day taken out of his check for retirement thats good thats smart i wish i could talk my daughter into realizing that she works at TI also well thats and she needs yeah at the TI in Sherman or no she works at the Expressway site uh SC Building okay well uh um thats about the only thing were doing for retirement now when i worked i wanted to go to TI i was wanting to become a TIer that way i could get some benefits because most the jobs around here you cant get benefits i know isnt that a shame especially if you well if you dont have a degree or something but ill go back to school one of these days and i will get me a see well i was uh forty five before i got my degree i uh started back when i was it took me nine years i was about thirty something before i even went back to school or even started college and i was forty five when i finally graduated well i was eighteen and i went and got my GED i quit the high school i just couldnt stand it and then course i hated it two years after i quit i wish id never done it oh yeah but then i i went and got my GED and i went to school and then i i loved college i was making a three point oh average i wasnt having hardly any problems except for with my computer class i did have problems there but uh now i was then i was old enough to know you know well im paying for it ive got to you know do something with it but then i wanted to stay home with the babies so yeah i stayed home with my kid i think i guess the longest i ever stayed home was eight years i stayed home with my kids and uh my son went ahead and graduated from college and my daughter has quite a few hours but she bless her she and her husband are you know kind of struggling hes a policeman vocalizednoise theyre both having and she works a second job too so she really doesnt have time i guess if she wanted to make time she could but and eventually i think shell go back when it really means something to her but right now thats not foremost and her she likes being with her little girl well were having a hard time right now too but its just who if the kid if kids dont have direction if their mother aint home directing them through the day kids are growing up wild nowadays oh i know it i know it my mom had to work and i i can feel the difference um a lot of well my husband had somebody to push him his mother was able to stay home with him more and you know he got his life straight at an early age which im not a i never i never went wild or anything but i still dont know what i want to be when i grow up and im twenty seven years old laughter i know laughterit laughterthats laughterme i here am i in my fifties and i still dont know what i want to laughterdo but my my mother didnt work she was always home so and it vocalizednoise didnt i guess really looking back knowing that she was always there when we got home from school my mother was there and what i did when my kids were growing up since i had to work i worked nights i was home i was sleepy but i was home when they got home from school yeah thats whats important isnt it you have to while im when they start going to school now my babys just three months old and im not having any more so im going to be there for them at least until theyre in the second well until the baby starts preschool uh kindergarten not preschool which it dont take long it seems like just yesterday that my little boy was born and hes fixing to go to school next year oh is he yeah theyre all growing up your your husband works for the railroad you say yeah he sure does oh now do do they have pretty good benefits there besides uh yeah their medical and dental is real good and uh like i said they do make it easy for you to thats where a lot of our money is going is toward his retirement but i want well like that once you know we get older is it sure oh yeah absolutely and well need it and like i said thats six dollars a day and oh i havent really sat down and figured it out but i guess itd be pretty easy three times six is what eighteen yeah so its a hundred and eighty a month oh once i did well yeah thatll add up fast fast fast absolutely yeah youre smart in doing that i would never quit that no well its its like this we dont see it so we dont really miss it well ive started uh thats right that i went the other day and had them start taking some money out of my uh savings my checking at work to in to put into savings account plus i buy a two hundred dollar a month a bond a month so theyll and theyll stack up faster than you realize yeah now i wish

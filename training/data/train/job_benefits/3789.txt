think of the job benefits you have well i i think uh so far theyve been pretty pretty good except the medical uh not not the medical the dental insurance the dental insurance yeah i yeah i think um um do you work for TI okay hum i know i went to have a tooth pulled and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldnt uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing laughter condition you know how you wait you wait as long as you can sometimes to to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it really vocalizednoise i i just thought that was that was pretty bad hm that does sound pretty bogus and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell fell off and uh they paid for the the cap but they wouldnt pay for the build up that sounds kind of strange and i didnt understand that laughtereither whos your whos your dental care through uh well uh its its a part of Aetna ours is through uh Cigna and its not too bad i mean i havent i havent been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits and uh they havent been bad they havent uh theyve been pretty good how about your uh do you have an HMO or well i had an HMO up to this year i switched you you went to like a regular plan vocalizednoise yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh oh okay you know because did it get expensive or yeah its gotten expensive because right now im im only i only have myself so i dont have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know umhum umhum umhum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh laughter i personally i i think HMOs are scammy now laughter just because uh its only five dollars a visit every time i go thats not bad okay and its five dollars prescription every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking you know laughter and so if i go to make a like i i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor and they wouldnt let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and im yeah that was a problem that i had with them toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them i got okay but uh and i didnt go back well i was just really annoyed with them because i uh i i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you dont give me an appointment im just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill yeah thats what i thought about later i wouldve probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill umhum umhum and and thats thats the only way youre going to get any action out of them you know if you threaten them with that laughteryou laughterknow because i said i just had the accident and i dont wanna wait too long before anything happens theyre like well wait another day and call us back and im like i dont wanna wait another day i want an appointment now yeah after i really thought about it some more the i i really couldve done that but um i was hospitalized uh uh about three years ago i had some surgery and Kaiser was really good for that because i didnt have to pay any of it at all yeah its its real handy once youre you know if you like my roommate broke his arm and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like i dont know im im only twenty four years old you know i dont really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years ive only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical  yeah so you know for me you know i dont i dont see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know  yeah so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible well i went to the doctor once and it cost me ninety laughterbucks laughterso it was like oh well i guess i couldve done pretty good with the five dollar visit yeah  well my uh my Kaiser premium  would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year wow thats a lot and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that hum yeah Kaisers expensive i mean i think its uh this year its like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars so i went back to Aetna because i i wont have to pay anything yeah that works that works out pretty handy and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick no yeah you know it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best

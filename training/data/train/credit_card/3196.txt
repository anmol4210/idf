hello hello hi boy it took forever to find somebody laughter oh laughter well im glad you found me good well im my names Gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards yes my name is Carolyn okay well if youre ready then uh okay ill just let you start ill vocalizednoise okay ill press one okay well im not laughter this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall laughter  i just find it so easy to to charge something when i dont have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so i think theyre kind of dangerous i think they are too and unfortunately um we use ours in we dont use them all the time but we use them like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that laughter but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half yeah me too laughter i think sometimes when you look at the interest that youre paying on them um thats what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really get a lot more stuff laughter if you were just able to pay outright for it yeah thats true thats true seems just like our society is so um pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this theyre really trying to get you into that uh situation because they know theyve really got you then thats right yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and its just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well thats probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on at that point and then it seems like  takes forever to pay that off laughter laughter its funny that uh weve got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago and we still owe i mean i i think like half  of the amount that they cost in the first place its just uh you know you just never never get get it out and uh thats thats real irritating to have laughter it sure is we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards and the interest on the loan was cheaper  than it was you know to just have that we havent done it lately we probably need to do it again well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure well give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck and they said sure thats no problem but you know why dont we consolidate your bills and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and its gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didnt realize at the time uh until several months later that we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didnt you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again oh no laughteryeah so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem  so we were paying like twice  oh um  so we didnt ever made that mistake again luckily  but uh were definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this its real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church laughtertalking about debt and things like that i just its so so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car and uh if you could stick to that you know wed get rid of a lot of indigestion laughter and everything else yeah   yep laughter sure thats true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over her yeah what a mess you are  oh dear oh so i dont know if i if i i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and so he said okay well keep it and then we werent smart enough to not use it so  you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though its just like keep now we just dont

 ive got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our moneys worth um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste its about uh twenty percent of the federal budget isnt it at this moment its terrible you know its huge i have no idea what the actual number really is but it but you cant unfortunately you cant do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and not at this point in the business cycle you cant yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in twenty years ago we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after World War Two and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh then at the end of the Johnson Administration the budget Nixons first year that was that was uh set up by Johnson was balanced and that was the last balanced budget weve got well of course part of the problem is that that um the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit yeah absolutely i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions we yeah absolutely and thats thats a terrible problem as well we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen eighty six began as a tax simplification law which wouldve made it easier to enforce and wouldve saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order umhum umhum and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i wouldve said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent im going to veto it well as much as thats a bad thing i think that uh theres some other really major major things that need straightened out and youd mentioned waste a little while ago and uh ive seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasnt going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts that company said theyd go ahead and build these things and they didnt build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there another thing that that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at ATT Gilford Center and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy im not sure what its called vocalizednoise called but its some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean theyre still working with a sixteen bit address space uh no and theyre writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago i dont know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but youd think at some stage theyd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current yeah i really wish there was some solution to this vocalizednoise bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big well the Republican solution is to cut taxes and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesnt solve it we havent gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result its gotten worse but uh not limiting taxes didnt hasnt stopped uh the government from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now weve got this giant deficit on top of things thats right thats right um so i i i dont know i mean there there theres only three things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment people dont want programs cut although uh im not sure that some of them shouldnt be looked at more carefully programs uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids uh im a little concerned about that im a little concerned laughterabout cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them uhhuh uhhuh but uh theres there there you know Governor Thompson of Wisconsin has an idea which is pay the fathers of these children to marry the mothers and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the fathers to take up some of the some of

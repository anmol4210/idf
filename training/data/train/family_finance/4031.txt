is all you need i think just one is all you need yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do yall have a family budget well we dont right now were planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue oh yeah ive heard of that youve youve heard of him its really its been really good weve um were on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know were gonna spend and um the rest we have in categories but for the most part its been somewhat discretionary um the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so we may spend a little more there and a little less in another in another area so um but its worked really well weve been able to save um you know what weve wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what weve wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing  well  we um i i keep the books and im the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend baside no you may not easide um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know  some people do um  envelope envelope envelope systems and stuff but i dont find that works real well for me well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain savings uh you know savings objectives yes we have um vocalizednoise we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and i mean where do you put that money uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of  it in CDs and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now were getting ready to put up a fence and that will come out of there its money that we havent budgeted for oh yeah it you know things you know things like that and then um thats where it will come from and if we dont have the money in there we have to wait until its you know up to where we where it needs to be thats probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted i im sorry i didnt i didnt hear you i say thats probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that youve planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or is that part of the system to discontinue that well he recommends that you dont um or he helps he recommends that you you get them down we weve never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um every month if we use them um were not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um  i dont know sometimes ill do mail order stuff and ill put it on there but it we always it always we will always work it out where where we pay it off at the end of the month so we dont put just a whole lot on there we dont use them just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards because that either youre not financed charged on there and you dont and you dont um you dont need to have cash there and they dont now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit so are you married vocalizednoise yes we are i am and uh weve got some children and uh you know weve just seen the need for well we just moved into a house uh that were renting and thats gonna which will suck up your money real laughterquick yeah yeah it really will so were you know were going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July and uh you know wed go out to eat on Sunday after church or something like that and i think were gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids

 yeah they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago well theyve uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly we just uh passed a new one uh fortunately or unfortunately it doesnt go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines oh right Indianapolis got that didnt they right and uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes but uh at least we thought wed get something back from that uh how do you feel about taxes oh it seems like a big politics game like up here last year the governors up for reelection so he said the budget was fine and that the state didnt have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes and now its election time again so theyre trying to lower them so theyre just talk about lowering them but they never do they just keep raising them ive never seen taxes really go down yeah me neither well actually theyre going to here because they didnt have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and theyre gonna lower it for next year oh  i guess they figure theyre gonna make up for all they didnt get when they shouldve had a budget i hope they put that in laughterwriting laughter yeah laughter yeah they say theyre gonna lower but ill see i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation  and uh that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor cant afford it either but uh i really feel like and and i feel like you know im a middle class person income incomewise anyway and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country yeah so do i i mean im a a middle class barely but uh i dont think the rich are paying more letless not enough i think theyre paying too much  you think the rich are paying too much yeah i mean if youre in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well thats ridiculous why bother working  well i dont know many rich that dont have enough tax breaks to i mean im talking about the really rich well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make thatd be fair now ill go along with that i you know yeah no loopholes or anything everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever right now i think that would be fair and i you know  no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review its just you know you make this you pay ten percent  if you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent yeah thats the way our state tax is here i think its pretty fair  our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal  and uh  they have not gotten it  where the withholding is accurate  oh laughter so and and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what theyre supposed to and at the end of the year its not enough oh great so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out right so now you know when you sign your W form or whatever W whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state  which is ridiculous but its been that way for the last probably ten years yeah i guess you you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you dont have it to give it to them right unless you have a lot of deductions but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you statewise  and you end up owing  you know you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and youre gonna owe  fifteen hundred in the state ouch laughter  and uh its its just ridiculous but i i dont know ive they just came up with a twenty five percent increase on personal property in in Oklahoma county  and that is a chunk yeah ill say laughter  i mean twenty five percent increase

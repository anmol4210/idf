Doug you want to start laughter you dont use any credit cards i dont imagine no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and and uh use them uhhuh do you use them a lot well we try not to were on a pretty strict and tight budget we use the credit cards however when were at a situation where we dont have either the cash or the checkbook handy or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on on an item that were purchasing so oh well thats an idea thats a thought umhum yes and basically we use it mainly when were traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they dont take local they dont take out of state checks umhum umhum and so when were traveling some do you use credit cards often my husband loves them uh we do use them uh we try not to but he hes one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month laughter oh yeah well thats thats a good thing because lot of people dont pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance he he likes doing that and thats when you get into expenses yes and you get in over your head  but itll uh some people i know also try to use it as float where they buy something now and say well im going to buy this when its good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when im being paid well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and its really useful thats true and some places wont take you know like a personal check or cash even but they would take a credit card how well how are the laws in Pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in Pennsylvania for example down here when you go to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash are they the same there we yeah we have the same thing up here so we dont deal where they do that laughter we charge you know we go to places where they dont charge extra some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more thats pretty steep and uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that we just dont uh go there because theres enough other ones around that dont charge you anything extra umhum umhum because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash to me they are anyways yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill right yeah are you saying that that way youre stranded not left stranded and high and dry laughter very good youre youre one of the the good i guess good yes yeah right laughter faithful shoppers that dont get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money well i cant say we never have now we have you know at times made payments laughteron laughterour things but we try not to we try real hard well yeah well  i see that as an advantage to a credit card also that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself so i think that theres a great advantage to a credit card in those situations yeah because sometimes uh theres times when you may maybe couldnt take advantage of something but with a credit card you can umhum um do you have uh multiple credit cards and do you find that advantageous or well i think were narrowing it down actually uh uh like i said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but we really get vocalizednoise when when you get down to the nitty gritty theres probably three that we use most of the time were were actually in the same boat we like to use three uh basic credit cards that way were not confused and we dont have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes to the end of the month umhum umhum do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail oh yes once a week twice laughtera laughterweek or three times a week its not every week but but you do get them they make it very readily available almost too much so but i really i really dont like it the charges they you know we try to limit look look at that also what they charge per year right so the annual fee for to use our money you know laughter theyre charging us to spend our money and i im not real crazy about that so we try to look at that also right right yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty three percent uh based upon what the state will allow

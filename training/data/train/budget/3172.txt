the budget seems to be oh on a number of peoples minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didnt spend money here and there i hear them talk about uh cutting what they call aid to some foreign countries and people dont understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh you start giving a country uh x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever you wish you know you would say well youre not acting right were gonna withhold it or youre not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever and the governments been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and im not sure if the general public uh thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little far fetched and not necessarily for the common good uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few and usually those who are um rich anyway laughteror have enough have enough money to attend those kind of functions so its vocalizednoise thats a a controversy of course theres only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy millions a bit laughterand its something so what would you do or cut or change in the budget um i agree with you on the international aid and um i dont think a lot of people realize too on we cant live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um  uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia i know a lot of people feel that weve given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um its also in our countrys interest um to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like were the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come laughter to lend us a hand but um i do think uh  vocalizednoise this is a hard area im theres some areas that i feel uh need a lot of work um  and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that were in but unless they start working on it um it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable but im not sure exactly what practical uh steps uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think thats our future if we um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um its thats an area i would not want cut there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyones heard the stories of the several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um thereve been some gross laughtererrors most of the the national or the federal dollars that go toward any project uh people tend to want accountability but they dont want the socalled bigger government so they they wanna have fewer government employee

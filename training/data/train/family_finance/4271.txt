 ill start in the first place i dont have a family and i dont have a budget laughter i dont either laughter neither do i laughter its called scraping together laughter its called what laughter scraping together laughter yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we werent really destitute but we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money and so now i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget well i my family was vocalizednoise they were okay because i mean my dad uh he um was in the military and then he also had like two other jobs so we lived comfortably id say but um i pretty well i i get paid i work for the state um i get paid like once a month so i i kind of learn to to set aside a certain amount of money it you know that i could spend each week for like lunch and all this other kind you know expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it laughter so you dont keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your income what you income is and stuff uh well i know what my income is but uh uh my but as far as keeping records i i i have a a ledger that will uh uh how much i owe people whatever and i deduct it out of that oh so you do keep track of it yeah i i i keep i i keep track of it uh im not exactly accurate of it every month i mean laughter but you know i keep up with it like once every other month or so get it caught up do you actually balance it at the end of the month uh yeah im not real good about uh keeping track in checks and stuff like that but uh uh i always keep track of of the ledger who i pay and when and whatever and what the balance is well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since ive had a checkbook and im im thirty two now so for i guess fourteen or fifteen years ive had a checking account but ive never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check id transfer five hundred dollars in and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the banks and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking you know i should really do that laughter and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so itd keep the balance for me well i work with uh im work with an an accounting uh section of Department of Corrections in in North Carolina for the state so i i work with Lotus and DataEase a lot so i im real familiar with that so that comes second nature to you yeah my i still havent balanced i figure if i keep doing keep this up long enough eventually someday itll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced well i bank with Wachavia and they have this vocalizednoise system of of where you can call a number you can call and get all your checks and what your balance is and and what checks is cleared that month or whatever and i do that like maybe twice a month i check to see what you know what checks ive written and always write paid on it when its paid so i get an idea you know subtract what laughter what what i have in you know in the in my account and what ive ive written checks for that havent been cleared or whatever so i keep up with it that way too yeah well you spend more time on it than i do thats for sure uh i wouldnt say that i just you know i just i just dont want to write bad laughterchecks does your balance match balance match the banks at the at the end of the month um for the most part yeah i i ive got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me and tells me i need to get the money in or whatever so i say okay and i get it to her oh i dont get that i just get a letter that says we just charged you ten dollars please take care of this oh i wish i wish mined only charge me ten dollars or here they charge eighteen oh so you get a personal call but you also get the charge well not not all the time its its like uh this time i i i filed electronically my taxes and uh i didnt have quite enough for my mortgage payment and um i told her and i said im waiting for them to file that and they said if the mortgage payment you know check gets that before that and i said but it should be you know i it should be deposited before it hits but and it it didnt the mortgage check hit before but she told me that if it did not to worry about it that she would just uh she she wouldnt charge me she since i let her know a head of time that i was waiting on that and whatever so but the the mortgage payment was due so yeah you like to live on the edge i see laughter well sometimes yeah laughter uh uh i believe in that philosophy of of praying that it dont hit the bank before the check does or laughterdeposit laughterdoes if i want something bad enough i ill do it but normally i dont do that but in case its something thats vocalizednoise

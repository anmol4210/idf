well i think we pay too much in taxes laughter how about you well i think they waste what we pay excuse me i think they waste what what all the money that we pay yeah thats what i think too i dont know how you feel um we moved here from another state weve lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax and what you find out is theres one evils the same as the other here you dont theres no occupational tax but its a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going no its even its even higher in Dallas County so was it yeah its really i know its just um eight and a quarter i think yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and thats eight percent i said eight percent laughterwhat so its really kind of sad yeah and then i dont know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if youre strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst is that what you think yeah because it different at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they dont have to pay sometimes they have to pay even less taxes doesnt seem quite fair does it because they have the money to shelter things and i dont know somehow get a huh no it isnt oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we cant you know that make dont make that kind of money i dont know i mean if theyre in business and and theyre making money i i could see if theyre losing money but theyre making money then they should pay taxes then umhum i know and just somehow it doesnt seem you know and and theyre not you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh whats his name Willie Nelson i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody he didnt look that stupid why didnt he pay his taxes you know right umhum in a way its almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you i just file federal income tax every year and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much yeah i just got divorced so im single again so and you know its its its a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and theyre married that umhum and we right now we dont own any property we lease so were in the same we dont have children so were in the same kind of its not as bad as being single and divorced but its sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesnt even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean theres actually less tax implication if i dont work full time compared to what my husband does you know so its kind of hard whoever works less they get a tax credit for that excuse me if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that umhum right yeah otherwise youre just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or laughtersomething well its two thousand now yeah for everybody oh it is oh oh my well thats not too bad then you get a you get a child care exemption but its not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like well i think its about five or ten percent of that you know it doesnt even its not even  oh my goodness  yeah i guess thats my call i guess i better laughtergo oh okay okay well it was nice talking to you uhhuh byebye  nice talking to you byebye

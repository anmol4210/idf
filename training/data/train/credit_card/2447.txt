probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on uhhuh none at all huh right uh we used to have American Express and uh Visa that of course theres a yearly fee on i see yeah has it and we got rid of those we now have Discover we have a Visa that does not have a yearly fee and then we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we dont plan on keeping it the second year yeah that because im pretty frugal about things like that thats what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we dont have to pay a a fee at all and thats what i i know people who dont have any credit cards at all and im always amazed laughter because i dont know how they can get by without them it doesnt seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit laughtercard we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless youve left a credit card at the desk so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but yeah i like them  too with with us weve got insurance of course but due to my husbands work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice and then all the other the the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars laughteryeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i cant come up with laughteroh laughtermy can you do that on a credit card yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back oh for heaven sakes for the drugs yeah you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month laughterwhereas you know then i got to wait for the rest the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats you know during the the time because weve got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and thats usually enough time for the insurance to get back oh uhhuh i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i cant believe you know its like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good uh yes uhhuh uhhuh and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we cant use that one anymore well just get another one and thats like who you laughteri have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesnt know she has now uh she must rent a p post office box or something or i mean she couldnt beat him to the mail every month i wouldnt think because they both work and they uh hes a fireman so hes home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i dont know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it oh yeah but thats thats a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh thats just dishonest oh oh i would think so but theyve been married almost thirty five years so i think theyve done things laughterlike laughterthat laughterto laughtereach laughterother laughterfor laughtera laughterlong laughtertime oh well laughter laughtermaybe laughtermaybe laughtertheyll laughterbe laughterall laughterright i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would just be well i i think i would feel the same way id id really feel like id been deceived you know that that wasnt the thing to do yes yes well many many many many years ago uh i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen uh dining kitchen family room combination and i wanted to paper it  and i bought wallpaper from Sears catalog on my Sears card and at that time i was only able to pay about ten dollars a month which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off the balance by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so thats kind of been my motto yeah weve tried to do that weve paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before i i quit work two years ago to stay home with the kids and right and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in  uhhuh  but weve gone back the other way to some extent because because just because there are times when you just cant pay it all uhhuh uhhuh because there are just too many bills well as you say when youre taking children to the doctor and adults too it does make a difference our children are matured out of the home and uh our needs are much different than they were uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without one but uh we have a Discover card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those laughter oh isnt that silly i i sent that one back because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth during the year and what we and and i think we got back fifty cents or laughtersomething it was like please what is this this is and the interest rate on it was was eighteen or nineteen percent did you laughter laughteryeah laughteryeah and our Visa card was we could get through our credit union was like fourteen percent so we just we sent it back we we keep gas credit cards and we have Visa and then i have started my own business i have a photography business and i went ahead and got a separate Visa just for that photography business because there are things that i have to buy and and with my photography when i when i take things to the lab to get developed its several hundred dollars at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit with my photography business even though again its paying off every month because im im putting everything im im uh you know im getting the pictures and im taking them back to the people i already have their money but i wasnt depositing them until i gave them the pictures back another practice i found im going to have to stop hot checks laughter you wouldnt think for a for a twelve dollar school picture that uh that people would write a hot check but they do oh i laughtersee oh dear  well i think those are the same people who have their credit cards uh charged up to the max and thats just a way of life i guess i guess its just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee uhhuh uhhuh for a returned check so now shes already doubled the price of her check and ive sent it through a second time because they said theres money in the account now you know and and if it doesnt go through the second time that womans out thirty bucks for one twelve dollar check its never quite made sense to me but then uh for one twelve dollar check when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it laughtergosh laughter so  i dont know why he you know didnt go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but hes going to have a debt going out the ear vocalizednoise i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing laughter so weve we have a little problem with our gas card were uh weve always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh we its very difficult to find their stations so i guess thats one reason why we use uh weve used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even uh uhhuh  well we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now theyre charging the extra five cents to use your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else is not anymore theyll take it you know at the cash price or you theyll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month i thought that was illegal whats that writing a check for gas no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card well all of them down down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price oh so what theyre doing theyre discounting for cash is the way theyre because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so right thats thats supposedly thats that theyre looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but right and and theyve changed that now now baside stop it go play and leave me alone easide laughteryeah and so im using the other ones now because theyre just as easy to get to and then theyre nickel a gallon cheaper so umhum so what were saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if its going to cost us money we dont though laughter we laughtertry laughternot laughterto laughterwere laughterprobably laughterthe laughteronly laughtertwo laughterpeople laughterin laughterthe laughterUnited laughterStates laughterthe laughterbank the banks dont want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest and leave us laughter oh i guess they must they must make a ton vocalizednoise theres not too many places you can make eighteen percent interest on things anymore thats right thats right thats what we need see you and i need to get in the credit card business laughterwe laughterneed laughterto laughterstart laughterour laughterown laughtercredit laughtercard laughter laughterif laughteryou laughtercan laughteryeah because you sure cant get that interest anyway else gosh i guess so laughter that would be wonderful wouldnt it laughter huhuh huhuh not on those CDs were trying to live on laughter uh yeah oh yeah ours are like seven percent weve got one and with with IRA stuff in it and uh jeez you cant get any interest rates my folks have just retired just in the last couple of months my dad has and uh theyre trying to figure out you know what theyre doing with stuff and my moms in there cutting up the credit laughtercards laughter you know cant use these laughteranymore and sure sure yeah well like i say the only reason we do in fact i when my husband and i were vocalizednoise

okay Ray what do you think about taxes too high obviously umhum yeah i agree but my property taxes have been going up repeatedly uh over the last uh well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that theyve increased oh really um and theyre always saying if you know if they dont raise taxes then theyre going to have to lay off on uh the teachers theyre going to have to lay of uh firemen theyre going to have to lay off the police officers but yet they dont talk anything about the administration about cutting back on that end of it they just theyve theyre in the middle of an expose now on the state and the City of Providence uh public works departments uhhuh yeah and theyve had TV cameras going around uh they wait at some of the yards and they follow the trucks as they come out uh at random just to see what they do during the course of the day and theres not much thats going on ill tell you i mean theyre going to gin mills and and spending half a day in there drinking or theyre going to other peoples homes and doing work oh so youve got you have you have a little graft and corruption huh uh i think thats in any city or town i think i dont think theres any that are free from graft and corruption uh if they could eliminate something like that yeah you know the waste you know thats i think uh  i i think thats a big problem uh uh i dont do you think you get some good services for your taxes do you have a good school district do you have i thought we always did i grew up in a town it was its a small town its in Rhode Island actually i live in Rhode Island i work in Massachusetts about uh six seven months ago they had a breakdown of all school systems and how many children actually once they once they get into the school system how many actually graduate and i was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town yeah around fifty percent uh not quite it was up there it was the forty percentile range yeah thats thats pretty much i think nationwide its you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country yeah thats for school districts im not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that but some schools i i dont know see i i live in a small community  and um we dont pay much in taxes i dont uh this sets this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services we have uh probably whats considered the third worst maybe the fourth worst school district in uh in the in the state other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my for my my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return but my employment tax you know the federal i dont think i get a good federal return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isnt probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer um but i didnt think that was too bad yeah  mine are right now theyre two thousand dollars just a little over two thousand do you own a lot of property just a or a small lot no uh a third of an acre and uh its a colonial house that we have its a saltbox its uh twelve years old the uh  plus the plus the personal property tax we get taxed on our automobiles oh do you see we dont do that and then the the town also has a fire tax so we get a fire tax added to the uh everything on top of that  and its the bulk of its going for the school system yeah see i i but we had uh  when i when i got out of school i i went up and i worked in a in a missile plant up in uh Buffalo and up there they had like all our fire departments were volunteers they had uh the best of equipment and and the best of training a and it didnt really you mean you have a fulltime fire department no fulltime is that what you have now though in your town yes yes weve got all fulltime fire departments how many about how my goodness see thats see thats down here um  being a member of we have we have a couple fulltime firemen but basically you know they well train the guys and they run the show and they live in the firehouse and you know and then most everybody else is volunteer oh okay and then you have call so theres like a core of like each station has like two or four fulltime then everybody else is a volunteer yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here and now theyre all paid which is you know i dont know we can theres a lot of things that can be done uh the federal taxes are out of sight because of yeah oh that just federal taxes just more and more and more and less and less services you know thats it they just keep they dont cut anything and it just feeds on itself and i dont think theres anything that anyone can do anymore its just grown to such proportions yeah such its just out of hand i agree you know the the whole idea like around here um  you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting oh yeah but because of Desert Storm now they said well we cant cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed but you know if we dont cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we dont need such a large army and we dont need if the military comes out and says we dont need all these planes then why does Congress say tough take them anyway you know well its like the  the tanks now everyones after the tanks theyre the you know like the the Mach One is it the Mach One Abrams um i dont know how much it costs lets lets round figure just say a million dollars  now for a million dollars you can produce probably a thousand handheld antitank weapons and you give them to a thousand peasants you dont even have to train them and out of one of those thousands one of them is going to hit now you take out a million dollar tank with a with a you know with a one thousand dollar antitank weapon right but theyre but theyre still going with the with the mechanized vocalizednoise its like the its like the old days when they had the cavalry they didnt want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps or whatever they were doing then and you know a million dollars do you know how many people that would feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls and get and keep in school and you know if we vocalizednoise uh i just in some ways i just dont you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didnt spend the money and they didnt then theyre overruns and if it didnt cost a hundred dollars for a hammer uh you would put a lot of people out of work but those people you put out of work you could you could rechannel their energies into making a rapid transit system in this country thats right oh i agree with you a hundred percent you know our direction has really you know solar energy uh you know theres been some recent great discoveries in solar energy surprisingly because theres theres no money invested in it thats right no um in fact in fact TI just announced uh some breakthroughs in solar energy yeah a big thing you know some flex a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to its being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and they just keep the taxes keep going uh they just keep yeah it that just just for those just for those groups and weve got like the the uh Groton Connecticut where they make the subs and weve got a division in uh in uh Quansett that does it that does the same thing so when they announced the contract up here for that latest uh sub i guess uh Newport News said they were going to sue the government because of you know blah blah this and blah blah that whatever it was but its generating jobs up here for us but its really its really not if you look at the whole you know its generating jobs for a few people if they channeled their energies if they go back to like when Roosevelt put put in the C C C camps and they built border ways for the reservoirs and you know highways and bridges and yeah um and highways see thats a big problem we have um im originally from Pennsylvania and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every bridge oh okay that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh is that right and there are yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didnt affect Boston it went the uh a highway from New Jersey west was it was it funded by by special bonds or im not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country

hi what do you do with your credit cards oh laughter well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we dont handle them very well we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more laughter laughteroh jeez they theyre theyre really bad for us um matter of fact weve gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa then and we pretty much keep those maxed out oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores yeah we had credit i had probably twenty credit cards umhum umhum um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um two Visas two MasterCards laughter oh gee laughter i mean i had any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble oh sure because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you umhum umhum um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you but each of these had an annual fee also right exactly and the American Express was probably the worst the worst um because the with the Gold card i cant remember how much it was because i didnt even have it very long before i gave it up but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year yeah im forty five right i laughter i which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month exactly you know i thats it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free and um then then i also limited it to one of each one MasterCard and one one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually i then got a Discover card since they pay you back umhum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing it really wasnt my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service umhum umhum um because my husband and i just dont handle credit very well umhum yeah and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out oh i see so im still paying on all these accounts but laughter my accounts are closed so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once were paid off i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and thats it yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards every month only once in my life have i not paid i think thats a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash right and umhum umhum um its a lot easier to keep it in check well and also in a sense theyre giving you a loan for a month so that you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i dont do but but yeah the the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what i buy i just i cant accept yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is i think that um its going to get even worse im im glad that were starting to pay our debts off off now you know we started we started i mean we started this last year umhum umhum and we probably still have about another year to go before were completely out of the hole but i think this they way the whole economys is going right now its just not good to be in debt thats right thats right yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people i guess because i never laughterexperienced it and its not because you know im rich or anything its just uh a mental concept that i have yeah that i just well when when its you when youre getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good laughterat it uhhuh uhhuh and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually itd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face right right but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and youre coming out of it all right i yeah i have ive learned a lot from it um ive learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand laughter umhum umhum and my husbands too because hes hes the same way i am i dont i dont think that well when we when we buy on credit we just dont have a concept of how much money were spending until the bill comes in and all then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much laughter umhum but now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um transmission fell out on our car laughter uh yeah and that paid for a new transmission um and and things like that um and we try we try not to use them for you know incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that umhum umhum clothing laughtersales sales i find are a pain laughter ive ive gotten ive gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i i pay by check a lot more now well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like youre youve really got it under control i i admire you for for having that um uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i i would thats ideally the where where i would like to be umhum umhum yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldnt because my sons tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite at that point but um yeah i didnt like it at all i was very uncomfortable laughter so you know and and i mean it was i can imagine i thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and im going jeez thats outrageous laughter but in in you know retrospect it wasnt all that much i mean a lot of people pay a lot more and oh yeah and you know but still i mean i figured i didnt need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars exactly laughter groceries for a week laughter yeah yeah yeah i i think about all all the money that that weve spent on interest on all of our credit cards and its just incredible but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax weve never been able to take it off our income tax im im fairly newly married ive only been married um less than two years and before that i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions right right so really it was always just money thrown away yeah jeez thrown away and i never really thought about it because you were good at it laughter yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and you know just dont talk about it most most people dont like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think umhum umhum umhum you know because i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal very personal yeah and especially if you if you dont feel youre handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be but i i think the the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt um because thats you have you have to have a roof over your head and i would much rather own my own home than than be renting it like were doing i mean were basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away were renting a house but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is theres nobody in the world thats going to give us a mortgage on a house right right but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year youll be in very good shape yeah its its going to its going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years well be in our own home but um im not really counting on it real soon umhum umhum so thats thats been an even harder lesson then if it affected

okay youve do you have a uh monthly budget well um we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i i think im a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts well have our checking account thats just the the money that we use and spend and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check so were never we pay off our bills in full were not paying any interest but its not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already and then we have another checking account another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know thats just taken out of our paychecks every week and then we have a a fourth sort of CD type arrangement um where you know its in a CD and we cant get to it so i guess our budget is just whats in our checkbook we dont say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas its just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times um so theres nothing really that we have written down for a budget but im a saver i would rather if i had twenty extra dollars i would rather save it than spend it and thats my philosophy and um sometimes i i you know i think that thats not necessarily the best way to live but i i always think that youre going to need it for a rainy day you know how about you well were very very similar we i have worked for a goal of saving three months salary and and we put that uh in a account and we just leave it there thats our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months salary now weve only weve recently done that so now we have extra money we dont have to slap in that account so were looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money uh see we do have the checking account we have Carla works for TI so she has a CODA plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar she she puts in a dollar you know TI pays fifty cents oh thats great its sort of like a matching fund then she gets like eight percent interest on top of that so thats been uh pretty juicy for last couple of years umhum yeah thats wonderful one nice thing that my company does um and i know this is going on all over the country but they allow you to put into um a certain fund whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year lets say you determine thats five hundred dollars theyll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two and what what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars do you have something like that no well they may have we just havent taken advantage of it its really wonderful in our case we dont have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week thats taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the its Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasnt taxed on initially because it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and its really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year i im just going to claim a lot more if you dont spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it huh so but uh its a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if youd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and theyll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing but um so if you dont use it in one year you lose the hum yes if you dont lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty they let you know each quarter and theyll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you havent spent that fifty then you do lose it well its time to go get your teeth cleaned again yeah right laughter or just buy a new set of glasses or laughter or whatever oh yeah thats thats true too but i i dont know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget thats really written out um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks youre just going to go over that and some weeks youre going to go under and so to me its just easier to well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money were going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it i dont know yeah thats true thats true thats true yeah a very good point so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because i hate interest laughter yeah right oh i hate it too so i mean but some people dont care about interest well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left theyll spend that because they think they have it and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically right its a vicious circle yeah it really is yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly but they can be very dangerous if you dont oh they sure can thats for sure especially yeah that interest is terrible i know and you know they send these applications out to college kids and college kid gets an application that says youve been approved for this amount of credit vocalizednoise automatic approval and they get them and then these kids start charging and and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they laughtereven start making money theyre already in debt laughteryou laughterknow let alone loans and stuff oh yeah no kidding yeah that sounds like you uh now what are you doing youve got your big master savings account that youre going to use to retire on or something or well itll be a long time before thats something we can retire on but um its yeah its just uh something thats automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed oh man and it wasnt covered by insurance so thats something where you you dont plan on its not something that you can you know youre not saving for a trip or whatever its boom here it is and you just have to pay for it so its an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that thats whats put in the CD and to me i i try and forget that we even have that because i dont want to think about that um but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe well just go out and buy something with this and itll come yeah yeah we i just did that my wifes birthday was yesterday and yeah so ah really im very tight you know with my cash and we havent really we dont go to malls and shop because theyre too expensive and you know well buy things here and there but she had we havent really went shopping for her umhum laughter oh yeah itll and you know but shes been really good and she hasnt really said much and i go well look you know today were going to go out and get something so we went out and blew about a hundred bucks but you know for us thats a thats huge for me you know but you know some people do it every weekend oh isnt it great oh i know you mean umhum oh its incredible we really do i i i like discount stores i have no problem with buying an a no name brand of something um im not into labels and that sort of thing our fire our smoke detectors going off laughter making French fries uh oh youre not cooking are you um my husbands making French fries laughter or burning French fries one or the other but um thats funny i feel fortunate that my parents instilled in me you know a sense to save and and you know watch where your money goes and i thats very valuable yeah yeah well thats good thats good sounds like uh you know what youre doing yeah i hope so we do you too was your wife always like this or was she did you have to did i have to train her yeah laughter no she shes really good she uh she didnt uh you know she doesnt go out and buy clothes without me knowing it and like Blondie in the cartoons you know she doesnt do anything like that shes not big on sales and all that shes just really shes really great shes really content and just uses what she has and then i know kind thats great you know she just you know some day

 who uh does your family keep a budget at all or well i sort of i mean in my mind laughteri laughterdo i dont write anything down or anything like that  ah i just know what my bills are and how much i need for that and whats extra im a nurse and so i kind of figure im taking home a hundred dollars a day oh really so when i look at things like to buy or anything i think of it in days if i hear something is three hundred dollars i think hm thats three extra days you know something laughterlike laughterthat laughterso so everything in my mind is by days and thats thats about the extent of my laughterbudget yeah three extra days youd a yeah about it huh yeah weve uh weve been trying to save for a house weve been really trying to penny pinch and oh thats a good one i tell you it gets tough when you know we have ive tried to write something out on a computer and stuff but it seems like every week theres something that comes up and makes it about impossible to well thats what happens thats exactly what happens it car breaks down or somebody gets sick or laughter umhum umhum so just when you think you might get a little ahead thats right thats what happens so thats kind of hard but are you uh are you able to plan or save anything for the healthy future or laughterno i know it its a day to day thing no laughter no not at all not at all i i barely get laughterby yeah i know all thats we i have my wife and a daughter and its about impossible yeah its hard its real hard and uh it doesnt get much better laughtereither laughterthats laughterhow laughterit laughtergoes laughterbut i know but you know i just think that laughter well thats good to hear laughter youre marked and youre supposed to have x amount of dollars and thats the way its gonna laughterbe laughteryou laughterknow laughteri laughtermean thats just thats how it feels really because its its just some people are just laughter and theres nothing you can do about it huh have more money and some dont and thats it laughter so  uhhuh and and im lucky i have a very low mortgage payment because i i had my house for a long time and yeah it makes you wonder how they get it all i mean  oh do you i dont have a car payment and you know i i dont have a lot of things so im pretty lucky but i have to make come up with the money totally by myself so thats hard too you know just it yeah well thats whats amazed us is weve been trying to get into a house and i just i just with what we make a payment i mean its about double what we pay for rent i just cant see how people do it these days yeah how is housing there well its actually Utahs been lucky we havent been hit by the recession so housing prices have stayed up the only thing thats helping us is that the mortgage rates are going down but uh its still moving pretty brisk and i say weve been kind of lucky we havent been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has yeah yeah weve been able to stay out of you know that we havent lost many jobs or anything like that up around yeah well im lucky ill never lose yeah that nursing but you know it doesnt matter if i lose a job one place ill just go somewhere else so yeah ive often said if i had it to do all over again i think id laughtergo laughterinto laughtersomething like that i seems like theres always you look in the paper and theres a huge demand for nursing and stuff so oh oh yeah really and and they get a little picky in one place and i know where i am now theres a whole big new administration and theyre theyre scaring everybody to death but i dont work on staff i just work on call oh do you you just work on call huh and umhum and so i have a couple of agencies that i work for and i make much more money that way and i can be independent i dont have to go to all the meetings and get into the politics and i dont get the benefits but i think its more than worth it then i just pay for that so yeah its a great thing but its risky and most people dont wanna oh yeah definitely definitely sounds yeah but it sounds like youve been doing all right with it so do that yeah ive i feel like it you know and its much more interesting that way too you dont get burned out so much so yeah so do you have a family or yeah i have a twelve year old and so yeah i have to you know take care of laughterher laughterso yeah so we know weve got to cover

know how young people buy houses today or anything i really dont know and and a small little you know two bedroom home with you know five hundred square feet is about sixty thousand it seems like and

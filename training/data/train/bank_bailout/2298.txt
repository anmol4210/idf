okay you want to go first well uh topic being the banking crisis uh thats a real hot topic laughter real real mess i guess you must say yeah sure is yeah it is of course you youve youve had your fair share of that down your way too oh yeah think uh probably i guess its pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think Texas probably uh suffered and or caused the uh laughter the major or a good portion of it no argument here yeah i i think that uh now im im no financial expert but from what ive read and heard that makes two of us yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make uh riskier uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the  the major culprit um with the oil crisis well also in investments investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicted predicated on uh a certain price per barrel to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasnt any way to break even yeah i guess that was the immediate cause uh shoot i dont uh i tell you one thing as far as the way theyre handling it i uh i feel pretty strongly about this and thats i think theyre over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers yeah yeah i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum and on the other hand i dont know whether theyre doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real you know the the presidents of the banks and those people that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that didnt didnt they just uh put another another thirty billion dollar BandAid on the problem last week or something uh im not sure i didnt President approved some more money to bail them out yeah its going to be uh its uh your and my money thats doing that you know thats unfortunately well thats true of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation and uh at some point in time its either going to be repaid or just completely blown off im not sure which which one is which i i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them out of it yeah now i im a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years ive heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i dont know how many decades it didnt happen and uh i dont know what its what its going to take to turn that around thats a good point they uh they got a little uh a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully theyll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial uh lets see what were some of the other other points she mentioned topic wise uh do we think enough is being done to address it i i i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i dont i dont remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were it seems to me like they really havent uh at least they havent if theyre doing anything its still pretty much uh uh not out in the open its uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh right right panels or whatever you know committees or investigations nothing uh nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i dont think thats true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf maybe now uh that were putting that behind us that well be able to to address this in more depth does tend to uh push that out of the front page well hey its been real good talking with you yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that yeah i think uh one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh whats whats the its capacity was short that day or something whats the minimum is that like three minutes i dont think there is a i dont know if there is a minimum oh okay so im uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end i i think so too nice talking with you you bet byebye

well Jackie uh on taxes i id guess id have to say that i my opinion is that id do think that Americans are paying too much in taxes uh whats your feeling about that i agree i think taxes are high where you live do you you have a state income tax and a sales tax both um yes uhhuh uh uhhuh yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent and we have uh what we call the five Bs uh vocalizednoise for our taxes booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes vocalizednoise yeah i agree i agree vocalizednoise i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting um well if you do get money back from  like jobs like im still a student so um i only work part time so i i get a check back well thats nice from from taxes but nice to nice to get a refund yeah laughterit laughteris but laughter its not much laughter uhhuh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh were getting value for it uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say theyre going to send some back its like giving yourself a transfusion its like one arm giving the other a transfusion you know what i mean uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because yeah there you go right because uh yeah theres an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh theres a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you yeah i dont know i dont doesnt seem like theyre doing much with it neither i mean theres plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i mean they have nice plans and um but laughter they dont always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i dont what happens with laughterall the money because if their plans dont work you know and the taxes get raised i dont know im not you know really into politics i dont really understand it but thats it its just you know laughter well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend uh its almost like theyll spend as much as the they were were theyre allowed to collect you know um  i theres an interesting proposal thats been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax youd have a certain amount i mean you you take your total salary uh those who made under a certain amount wouldnt have owe any taxes and then thered be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you you know after you uh figure out  you know whos in your family right huh and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know yeah that could be nice laughter i id like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a lot you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and im sure theyll fight it tooth and nail but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans  i mean it doesnt seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes doesnt seem fair to me yeah it isnt theres not much out there thats fair laughterthats for sure laughter laughterhuh ill agree to that right i think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high i i if im not mistaken arent they i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is um no i i have no idea i just twenty percent my dad does laughterit laughterall laughterfor laughterme you just pay it huh laughter laughter i use youre like youre like my daughter whos in in college down in Massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and shes attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and

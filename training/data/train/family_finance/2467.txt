so uh describe your family budget well ive uh for a lot of years ive ive pretty much flied without one and uh just recently uh we we set up a budget and and were trying to stick to it we just bought a new house so weve got everything you know pretty much we know what our uh our fixed expenses are per month and then weve got some ones that are variable that that pretty much stay within a certain range and then uh then theres the ones that you never know anything about and thats the the food budget but that well yeah and to some extent uh utilities i imagine yeah well the utilities theyre pretty much uh uh you can pretty much uh figure what theyre going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where theyll average them out for you uh they have that to some extent here but its not quite as good and uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car yes sir and you know how much youre going to drive every week well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i i was very convenient i lived uh uh nine tenths of a mile from work so so was uh you know two miles a day laughter to and from work laughter so it it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now ive just bought a new house and im a half hour and so my uh transportation costs have uh gone up by uh five times laughter yeah i understand that we we have a real similar situation ours have uh quintupled at least uh so there is a real family budget yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money uh i have uh three children and uh it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house and i can remember years ago when uh school would start and id go buy all five kids you know shoes and i could get out of the out of the uh out of the shoe store with uh out spending more than thirty five dollars nowadays thirty five dollars buys about one pair of shoes if youre lucky laughteryeah so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years exempt or nonexempt im exempt wow must be nice part of the high price spread uh no uh well we dont we do but we dont have a family budget we have the fixed things that we have to pay we have the things that are extras but it seems that by and large the extras just dont exist well you know the auto budget the car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry and insurance is insurance bad there ive got uh two older cars there both uh ones a seventy seven and ones a seventy eight well weve got one eighty nine and uh my insurance is about uh it was running about four hundred dollars a year but when i moved to the new town i live in because its a different county which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so its a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance companys concerned so my my i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year wow thats thats not bad four hundred and something a year thats thats well its actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars so  thats cheaper than we pay yeah yeah i was down in Texas for uh two years and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance um they well here in Colorado its even worse because we have uh no fault do you have that there uh in Maryland they uh they have no fault in Maryland also well no faults rather funny in Colorado because uh it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays its kind of its kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no ones injured the police wont even show up youre kidding they tell you if nobodys injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company vocalizednoise well if you i dont know how familiar you are with Maryland but uh especially the the the center part of Maryland where i ninety five runs through it is really heavily populated not at all and theres just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic they dont even try to keep up with it God so you lived in Texas for a while not a bit yes sir i spent uh couple years down there moved down there in eighty seven and moved out in eighty nine are where you from originally uh right here in Maryland huh so you just basically went home when you had a chance and my family yeah my family uh didnt like Texas and i had a chance to uh transfer up TI bought a company about seven months after i moved to Texas right here in Hunt Valley uh thats nice so i got an opportunity to transfer back and i took it God thats great uh no im a native Texan west Texan there is a difference laughteryeah believe me i know there is i lived in Plano and i dont know if youre familiar with Plano but Plano maybe five percent of the people in Plano actually were from Texas everybody else was an import well im im a west Texan Lubbock Midland Odessa Amarillo Dumas Panhandle a different world from down there so uh Colorados been fun but they have a real problem next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile and every time you look at a look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains you got to throw in a dollar or or so it seems i i may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive yeah yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland but i noticed when i was in the in the in Texas they didnt have a state income tax but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and school taxes and property taxes yeah yeah property taxes and yeah well Colorado oh my God ate you alive you know they have the state income tax but then they also have property taxes and they also have sales taxes and they just and they just get you every direction they can and i just dont know sir but they it seems like they trying to get you every which way yeah it sure does um theres uh some good books that ive read um that you might be interested in um Charles D Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on late night TV and hes got seminars you can go to and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks oh yeah but hes got a couple of books out uh one of them is called um  Wealth Without Risk ive heard of the book yes its a very good book its tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do what to do with the money that you save legally cut money on your taxes huh yes  yes sir legally legally cut money on your taxes and on your uh insurance and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to uh uh  you know be wealthier uh he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and havent had a chance to uh to crack it open yet um  Financial Self Defense i believe is the name of it uh the man uh has a lot of good ideas some of them i already knew about some of them i had already practiced but uh i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because uh and that includes everyone at TI laughteryes yes im one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety one yes well even the you know the non exempts technically yet we havent had our salary frozen but when youre only at living wage it doesnt matter you know survival is a funny state yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in Dallas i was supervisor and i had uh four non exempts um under me and uh i i was appalled at what the hell they were paying them i just couldnt believe it did well ive been with the company sixteen years now i was a WF for several years it just never never seems to improve it and it doesnt seem to get much better for the exempts either unless youre twenty eight or above its really a shame well i ive this company that they bought they ended up buying a very high payroll and uh the you know uh i thought i was making a good wage you know high wage till i came

okay vocalizednoise okay okay okay im uh well i do work for a large company uh large meaning about twelve uh twelve thousand people thats big and uh it use to be twice as big so couldve been uh couldve been better ill put it this way when i came to work here it was twenty five thousand and now its twelve thousand and dropping but uh the advantages of a vocalizednoise how how big is the company you work for uh less then a hundred people okay less then a hundred some of the same thing still applies ive work for companys uh your size before and some of the same thing still applies though uh one of the things is like i know a guy whos gone to work for himself and uh after a while he became yeah he was he craved uh vocalizednoise yeah interaction yeah and uh thats one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh do you have internet how did you get hooked up to this uh well i have an internet uh through another i have another internet connection through another network but were in the process of  establishing our own internet feed internet feed so things like that the internet uh access internet access to a library gee how do i say it uh well i think the diversity of a large company is a strong thing for it um the the fact that there are so many different ways that uh working for a company could take you a a large company um granted if your skill your skills were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow to to uh your choices are narrowed but i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess youd call them in a larger company im a systems engineer and i basically design networks um so for our end users and our customer im you know uh im pretty much limited to that thats what thats what i do one of the advantage of uh of a uh larger company and the hundred is uh could be consider a larger company is is uh access to other people that do the same thing if youre the only computer programmer in your company then its its it is kind of isolated and uh so thats one of the advantages uh there are lots of disadvantages of course but uh yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost anything getting anything done at all you have to  many layers to go through yes and one of the things that that uh tends to happen in in a larger company is uh oh how do i say it uh lack of access to uh to people uh they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size uh let see a hundred or so it i in the past uh had access to people who had access to just anything anything anything and everything was uh was available where as in a company like this its very fragmented and im i might be umhum and you have the typical pyramid structure of organization many work groups one man on top or woman um and middle management and the whole nine yards right yeah and so well i can be ten feet away from somebody that is doing the same thing we are structured in the uh in uh in uh bubble uh structure we are many different work groups however we work together um thats by design weve had the same structure for basically for twenty years and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facets into play as theyre needed so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh i i have one fear here i i dont know if i push the one button long enough i think you did do you think you can hear that huh okay because i i havent they havent said that were out of space yet maybe they deleted their temp directory laughter well in the past theyve it you know they seem to shut us off fairly quickly so i i was wondering about that let me try it once more here well um you know we can talk as long as we like or until they tell us ive usually hit the marker to um were not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh so were vocalizednoise were in a were in a bubble diagram and uh thats thats a really effective and i think that is a very nineties kind of thing like i say weve had it for twenty something years and so we are really good at it but uh

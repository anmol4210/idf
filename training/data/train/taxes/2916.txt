i dont think ive ever met anybody that thought they were paying too little taxes laughter i laughterhavent laughtereither i know i pay too much but laughterso so i assume that were going to agree that we all pay too much taxes right laughter but then the question is are we getting what we pay for and and i think we dont i i agree i agree i think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects absolutely i vocalizednoise fortunately we dont have state income tax i know you guys do and right well i lived in Texas for a long time so i was really hit hard by the nine percent California tacked on to the governments and its heading that way though oh gosh well i think in within the next few years were going to have it here theyre trying i know Texas uh just raised their sales tax again because uh i was visiting in Houston over Christmas with my mother and uh uh i went bought a few things and i think your sales tax is higher than ours now yes i know were just taxed probably is im telling and i pay enough in i pay income tax that some people make and it really just tears me up i cant laughterbelieve how much i pay but and for for what laughteri laughterdont laughterknow laughterwhat laughteri laughterget laughterfor laughterthat well i really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted on unnecessary unnecessary uh bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things i do too i do too i know there are we have we have uh hundreds of thousands of dollars going to uh people to supervise people who supervise people who supervise people and when it all comes out they dont do much supervising anyway you know and i know it or uh uh who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly and why do we have to laughterhave you know laughter well actually as a matter of fact that sort of research i think is worth spending some money on because the uh basic research really is whats made our country uh get to where it is in its ability to compete and i dont mind spending on on defense either uh that doesnt bother me at all course i work in a defense project company so laughternaturally laughterim for it but well i you i dont mind spending on defense for things that work but i mind having people uh uh people spend money to create five thousand pages of documentation to order something yes right right and you know those companies that that say they you know the this is crazy uh seven hundred dollar six thousand dollar toilet seat in reality it probably really does cost that because of all the paper work the government requires that you have to go through to make that toilet seat to sell it to them it probably does cost six thousand dollars yeah i think the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate expenditure given what the government requires of the manufacturer the manufacturers probably not making very much profit on that laughterprobably laughterno and no no but the probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to uh ridiculous kinds of of paper work and supervision uhhuh umhum umhum i know absolutely um are are you familiar with the Grace Commission no what is it well i dont remember exactly when when that started but it was back in the early eighties i think uh Peter Grace of WJ Grace and Company was uh appointed by i believe Reagan to um create a commission to investigate government purchasing and expenditures and see if there wasnt a way to save money and he came uh he and his group of course he didnt do it but he got people to do it came up with a a whole books worth of recommendations for making the government run more like a business and he said that you know the the kinds of things the government does even in renting space would drive a business bankrupt umhum umhum and uh people purchase things because of the rules that require them to buy certain kinds of things in certain ways that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um you know deal like a business and uh get things in quantity that will uh you give them a discount they ought to pay their bills on time one thing the government does is is stretch out the payments so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment right i know that anyway there was this whole book that came out and i read some excerpts from it and every single thing they recommended was so laughtereminently laughtereminently laughtersensible and and laughteri laughterknow they just it just astonishes me that we have not put more of that into practice i know it i know it just mind boggles your mind when you think think and its its scary to think that these guys are up there running running our laughtergovernment that that approve of all this stuff and everytime and everytime the uh Congress changes and people move offices they redecorate the whole office they spend half a million dollars on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been redone less than three years earlier i know it isnt that sick isnt that thats our tax dollars and then they come up with these crazy projects to do things like spend seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welks birth place a shrine laughteri laughtermean i do not need a national park around Lawrence Welks birth place i dont laughtereither and i can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred thousand dollars i know it but you know what can you do theres really i dont even i really dont what know what we can do about it uh the ways to other than well i dont think it does much good but i write my Congressman all the time ive got a congressman who is very concerned about uh uh irrational expenses and who is a real fiscal conservative umhum umhum thats good and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me uhhuh well thats good and uh i dont know that its going to help any but if he got uh if if a lot of Congressmen get that kind of input from their constituents maybe theyll do a little something umhum something be done maybe laughter yeah thats a key is maybe i know i uh i donate to work we have uh a thing to you can donate but of course what were donating our uh political party that were donodonating donating is whoever is is for the defense department you know of course our defense budget thats who our money our money goes to we really dont have any say so well im in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have i wouldnt either three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services its just dumb yes yes thats dumb theres no reason why we shouldnt have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them interchangeable absolutely i just whats wrong with that i then the same spare parts can laughterbe laughterused laughterin laughter in uh Air Force planes and Navy planes maybe laughter thats laughterright yeah yes i know i cant understand but i know our company my property tax goes up all the time im right at DFW airport so were we oh yeah we should be getting a tax break because we get all vocalizednoise the town i live in gets all of the uh revenue from DFW because its in our city limits but it doesnt all its  theyre just building these great big fancy homes and uh uh taxes are just going up and up but course my property the value of my homes going up too so that doesnt hurt thats always good laughter well thats good but thats thats small comfort because it doesnt bring you any income until you sell it thats true laughter laughteryou laughtergot laughterthat laughterright laughter now we dont have uh property taxes going up as much as you all do because we had proposition thirteen that says uh once you have had your house appraised then they can only raise the taxes laughter you got enoughs enough  i believe its two percent or maybe its three percent a year uh until you sell and then its reevaluated thats great oh okay well thats a good idea uh and thats that helps people on fixed incomes and older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but who dont want to move out of them yeah i keep reading where they say in in now Los Angeles area where the the property thing is just going to bust one of these days you know or and San Francisco too i think the prices prices of real estate is so high well the prices are so high i dont see how they can keep going up no i dont and they say that its going to come you know a lot of companies are moving out of California because they cant afford people cant afford to live there to work there so theyre moving i know Silicon Valley they say is just well im in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isnt anymore land left to build on most of the oh are you surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it cant be developed so theres very little property that hasnt already been built on oh okay umhum oh okay and one of the problems our city is having is that uh with all of the environmental requirements and the antidevelopment people taking over the city council weve driven out some corporations which were paying a lot of our taxes oh okay and so now theyre going to have to assess us because they weve driven out the businesses that were paying the freight laughter yeah now thats a shame laughter yeah for instance we have the Stamford Shopping Center which was uh paying oh i think it was about a quarter of our uh city budget because of the sales taxes that were collected there and in this recession a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their sales taxes have dropped and were about a million dollars below budget primarily because of the sales tax drop off and that uh and also Hewlett Packard was uh headquartered headquartered here and so everything that they sold the sales taxes uh were paid oh okay

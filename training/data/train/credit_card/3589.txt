 well my view i work for a financial institution and oh boy laughter yeah and i love my credit card uh you end up with more consumer rights by using credit cards than what do you mean by that uh what i mean is say you pay for something with a check your check clears youre out the bucks you pay for something with a credit card you dissatisfied are dissatisfied with it you take it back and they say sorry we you cant take it back if you know you can leave it there and then just have your Visa charged back oh whats your favorite credit card do you use Visa how come  get your money back well thats the kind we offer laughter oh thats a good reason thats a good reason and uh were just offering a a new card that gives you one up to one percent back of all the charges that you make cash back you know like Discovers i was gonna say i know Discover does that yep and were starting to do that Visas gonna do it too we are who all right who puts out your Visa card uh we do  America First Credit Union who is we America First Credit Union and youre gonna offer the cash back just like Discover does huh well i ill tell you that works because i use my Discover card more than any other credit card for that sole reason did you get much back hm  yeah laughter unfortunately i use my Discover card more than i ought to not a great deal i get i get about a check for about fifty some bucks at the end of the year usually well good for you that must mean and its one percent so you spend about five thousand laughter i shouldnt tell that to laughteryou thats pretty good well i i do better than that everything goes on mine and then ive got a business too that i use it for charging computers on well i tell you then then i have an exact account of everything ive bought its all printed out it is nice and as long as you keep your statements then you know exactly what youve spent and if you know when you bought something because often i wont remember and i can go back you know ill remember the month so i can go back to my my credit card invoice and there it is it tells me the exact date and everything well how many cards have you got well i have a whole slew of the them but i really i use i have a Visa um but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my uhhuh a debit card yes i dont like those yeah and so i dont either because its gone although they dont debit it until the end of the month yeah oh really thats interesting um but it still automatically comes off that month if i time it right then any like  my my date is the twelfth so if i charge something on the thirteenth then i dont get that bill till the end of the month and its not due till before the twelfth of the next month so i can put off paying for something for free for two months with a debit card no not with a debit card with my Discover card i can and and i use Discover more than any other because of the cash back oh credit oh okay i have MasterCard and then i have all the different department stores but i just really never use them and i try desperately hard to pay it off each month  yes because the the cost to use it is terrific is it twenty percent interest uh it varies from eighteen and a half to twenty one percent wow  and thats thats tremendous amount our cards thirteen and a half oh youre kidding me uh with a ten dollar annual fee how do you get one of yours well you have to be a member of our credit union and what credit union is that America First its were the vocalizednoise oh but see youre in Utah yeah yeah and youd have to be a resident of the state oh okay i was thinking about your brother laughterhe laughtersaid Jack and hell do that but thats youre nowhere near us wow  thats a neat idea though perhaps some other people around here will catch on and do it too uh do you have Mervyns and all those have you noticed that they all have started issuing their own credit cards oh yeah oh yeah they have for years but you can still use the three big ones MasterCard Visa and now Discover you can still use those three um at almost any department store what do you think of Discover uh Sears not taking anyone but theirs they have not done that for years yeah do you like that or do you think thats fair or laughter i dont know i used when i was a a kid laughter i worked for Sears and it im just  im so used to them not taking anybody but theirs theyll take Discover but see they back Discover too so it doesnt bother me because i use Discover most of the time yeah yeah its theirs ah okay lets see do you think that uh the move towards plastic is a good thing  i think i

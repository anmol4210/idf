 okay  uh i just currently quit my job and so i really dont receive any benefits right now laughter laughter laughterright but my husband does and um i think one of the um my first of all always salary and second the second thing is um because we have children so itd be um health benefits and medical benefits and and um right now we have yeah yeah definitely probably some excellent benefits right now we have with Aetna and uh i dont know if youre familiar with them but were real happy with them yeah yes ive had a variety of different jobs with of various types um in the computer field and so seen a variety of different types of benefits um ive worked for for vocalizednoise for awhile and they are you know really um an academic type of place and then ive worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff so ive seen a wide range of both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care thats either fully or partially paid and you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much of other types of benefits and so yeah i would id say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um and thats one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about taking changing jobs is you know you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me yeah yeah um and i guess support for whatever whatever other you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work um because ive been at places which offer a lot of support and others that dont offer any and some that sometimes thats coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so thats not so bad um you know its kind of a give and take kind of thing i think um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just losing you know losing all your salary cant laughtercant laughtereven begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something um and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices laughter and who to go with and that really helped us out a great deal but my husband does get vacation and its worked out really good for us too so  but yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because that makes a big difference my wife works part time and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and so two days a week i um manage to get home early enough to meet the kids from the bus  because she works you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon till close um so we have vocalizednoise  well thats great that yall can work that out thats really good yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldnt there wouldnt be anyway to do that at all and i think its kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because i mean usually you know you go to work before theyre awake or as theyre getting up for school and you get home and its already dark unless its summer time you know and even if its summer sometimes you get home so late that theres you know you cant do anything with them and especially in the winter i mean you get get up in the dark and come home in the laughterdark laughteryou laughterknow its like its like a vampire laughtersometimes yeah its that same with my husband because hes got pretty flexible hours if as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do with thats worked out really well for us too well is there anything else that you look for or um a lot of it to i guess is you hit pretty you put a lot of the main points in yeah i think some it is how the uh you know i guess its not really a direct benefit but how you um performance is rated and stuff like that at work because ive been uh especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting having you know real problems ive found out ive worked for a few you know several thousand plus  you know type companies and it especially if youre doing like professional work where there you know its kind of  ethereal as to what youre doing you know if youre like ive i work with uh computer systems a lot so its kind of hard to say you know if youre a you know brick layer somebody can look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didnt fall down  you know yeah you did a great job if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or if especially if you write like papers you know or do design studies or something its real hard to rate something like that its like being a painter or you know or something an artist its like well jeez how do you really rate you know Michelangelo you know  how would you tell if he was you know really good or  soso or whatever baside no easide and that does make want a person want to stay

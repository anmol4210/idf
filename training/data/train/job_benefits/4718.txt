okay well so what im sorry go ahead laughter what what kind of benefit uh benefits do you have at work well i im i work at a large company and uh we have quite a quite a few benefits and uh we have um the best benefit i like is the uh amount of uh vacation time especially after uh working working there for a long time it really build up to the amount of vacation time i i think thats one of my best benefits oh yeah is there a something that you wished you had that you dont or  well one thing that i i uh wish uh in a big company theres more bureaucracy and uh less support of uh what youre doing i think and uh thats something that um is uh probably and a benefit of a smaller company you get more support from the the people that you work for yeah i work for a relatively small company were a trade association for credit unions and uh our benefits are fairly good and like you say that support i mean you work directly with the president and the executive vice president and you know they you get the feedback from them directly and i like that but i wish i really the thing i like i guess i wouldnt mind having a better retirement plan we have just a defined benefit plan and i kind of would like the idea of having a K or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions thatd be a lot better i thats one thing i wish i had a little bit more of but youre really thinking of the future uh yeah i i dont know im kind of the type i just dont wanna work my whole life id rather be able to make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before and so thats and thats one way i can see doing it but none of them i work i work for the state of Florida and uh its pretty good retirement plan we dont get paid very much but uh retirement plan is pretty pretty good works good yeah thats like i say ours were we get uh vacation is pretty good too i mean its you get a week after the first year two after the second three after the third and it goes up just every year by a week up until i think like six years which is a lot better than anybody else id ever heard of uh yeah thats quite a bit of vacation to have after six years service so did you say you work for a credit union uh it its a a credit union league theyre kind of a trade association for credit unions we uh kind of do a lot of the uh political support and stuff like that for the credit different credit unions within the state yeah my wife used to work for a credit union group they magazine they had a newsletter that went out to all the oh did she all the uh credit union CEOs and people like that so she was really into the keeping up on whats going on with the credit unions oh really huh what what did she work for uh it was it was a company um i think it was called Credit Union News or something it was based out of uh i think it was Boca Raton Florida oh really yeah that sounds pretty familiar to me yeah it was pretty uh but uh pretty glossy kind of uh newsletter that comes out well uh  do you get to i dont know have you heard of any people that kind of do this uh the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose what kind of benefits you get or  uh not too much is that something that Florida does or where your work the state of Florida or you pretty much get what they give you and yeah just i get what what you give in uh thats uh not not uh with not too many choices yeah i guess a lot of the more uh some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them more because whatever you know men and women alike they give them say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but and if they whatever they dont use they get in cash but a lot of companies dont like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other wont so it saves the company money whereas this one you know youd end up paying regardless yeah i guess but for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea but anyway i havent uh havent got so fortunate as to get into any of those companies yet okay well well hey it was good talking to you all right see you later byebye okay bye
